SM,"Today the process of natural selection is totally misguided. It has reversed. Human race has been devolving very long time for now. Retarded and stupid , weak-minded people are reproducing more and faster than the intelligent, strong-minded people. Laws protect the retarded majority which selects the leaders of society. Modern human race has not only betrayed its ancestors, but the future generations too. Homo Sapiens, HAH! It is more like a Homo Idioticus to me! When I look at people I see every day in society, school and everywhere... I cant say I belong to same race as the lousy, miserable, arrogant, selfish human race! No! I have evolved one step above! Naturality has been discriminated through religions, ideologies, laws and other mass delusion systems. ",1
SM,"Individual, who is going through his/hers natural power process and trying to live naturally, but is being told that the way he acts or thinks is wrong and stupid, will usually have some reactions which might be considered as ""psychological disorders"" by the establishment. In reality they are just natural reactions to the disruption of natural power process. They will have some of the following depending on individual's personality feelings of inferiority / superiority, hostility, aggression, frustration, depression, self-hatred / hatred towards other people, suicidal / homicidal thought etc... and it is completely normal. Humans are just a species among other animals and world does not exist only for humans.",1
SM,"Death and killing is not a tragedy, it happens in nature all the time between all species. Not all human lives are important or worth saving. Only superior intelligent, self-aware, strong-minded individuals should survive while inferior stupid, retarded, weak-minded masses should perish. There is also another solution to the problem: stupid people as slaves and intelligent people as free. What I mean is that they who have free minds, are capable of intelligent existential and philosophical thinking and know what justice is, should be free and rulers... and the robotic masses, they can be slaves since they do not mind it now either and because their minds are on so retarded level. ",2
SM,"The gangsters that now rule societies, would of course get what they deserve. Of course there is a final solution too: death of entire human race. It would solve every problem of humanity. The faster human race is wiped out from this planet, the better... no one should be left alive. I have no mercy for the scum of earth, the pathetic human race. Collective deindividualization is a phenomenon where individual will be trained as part of the mindless herd controlled by state, corporation, church or some other organization, group, ideology, religion or mass delusion system and adopt it's rules, morality and codes of conduct. This phenomenon has been familiar in all despotic, authoritarian, totalitarian, monarchist, communist, socialist, nazi, fascist and religious societies troughout history. Also, the modern western democratic republics have the same phenomenon.",2
SM,"It is just done so that people will think they are free and don't realize they are being enslaved. Majority of people in society are weak-minded and ignorant retards, masses that act like programmed robots and accept voluntarily slavery. But not me! I am self-aware and realize what is going on in society! I have a free mind! And I choose to be free rather than live like a robot or slave. You can say I have a �god complex�, sure... then you have a �group complex�! Compared to you retarded masses, I am actually godlike. Totalitarian governments rule people through education system, consumerism, mass media, monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force police, military and laws discriminating people who think differently than the majority. Democracy... you think democracy means freedom and justice? You are wrong. Democracy is a dictatorship of the moral majority... and the majority is manipulated and ruled by the state mafia. Modern western democracy has nothing to do with freedom or justice; it is totalitarian and corrupted system.",0
SM,"Laws are made over the heads of the people and people are being brainwashed to support the system and connected to the institutional structures immediately after their birth. Societies are being ruled by manipulative and charismatic politicians who only care about the interests of majority, and who do not base their decisions on reason but emotions and feelings of the masses. These masses let the authorities of state to make all the important decisions for them. The masses will get an education, they study, get a job, go to work and vote in elections. They think they are free and don�t criticise or question the system. They have become robots. It is like a constructed mechanism in mind, that leaves little choice for an individual to think, talk and act independently. Hate, Im so full of it and I love it. That is one thing I really love.",1
SM,"Some time ago, I used to believe in humanity and I wanted to live a long and happy life... but then I woke up. I started to think deeper and realized things. But it was not easy to become existential... knowing as much as I know has made me unhappy, frustrated and angry. I just can�t be happy in the society or the reality I live. Due to long process of existential thinking, observing the society I live and some other things happened in my life... I have come to the point where I feel nothing but hate against humanity and human race. Life is just a meaningless coincidence... result of long process of evolution and many several factors, causes and effects. However, life is also something that an individual wants and determines it to be. And I'm the dictator and god of my own life. And me, I have chosen my way.",1
SM,"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause. I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection. You might ask yourselves, why did I do this and what do I want. Well, most of you are too arrogant and closed-minded to understand... You will proprably say me that I am �insane�, �crazy�, �psychopath�, �criminal� or crap like that. No, the truth is that I am just an animal, a human, an individual, a dissident. I have had enough. I don�t want to be part of this fucked up society. Like some other wise people have said in the past, human race is not worth fighting for or saving... only worth killing.",1
SM,"But... When my enemies will run and hide in fear when mentioning my name... When the gangsters of the corrupted governments have been shot in the streets... When the rule of idioracy and the democratic system has been replaced with justice... When intelligent people are finally free and rule the society instead of the idiocratic rule of majority... In that great day of deliverance, you will know what I want. Long live the revolution... revolution against the system, which enslaves not only the majority of weak-minded masses but also the small minority of strong-minded and intelligent individuals! If we want to live in a different world, we must act. We must rise against the enslaving, corrupted and totalitarian regimes and overthrow the tyrants, gangsters and the rule of idiocracy.",0
SM,"I can not alone change much but hopefully my actions will inspire all the intelligent people of the world and start some sort of revolution against the current systems. The system discriminating naturality and justice, is my enemy. The people living in the world of delusion and supporting this system are my enemies. I am ready to die for a cause I know is right, just and true... even if I would lose or the battle would be only remembered as evil... I will rather fight and die than live a long and unhappy life. And remember that this is my war, my ideas and my plans. Don�t blame anyone else for my actions than myself. Don not blame my parents or my friends. I told nobody about my plans and I always kept them inside my mind only. Don�t blame the movies I see, the music I hear, the games I play or the books I read. No, they had nothing to do with this.",1
SM,"This is my war: one man war against humanity, governments and weak-minded masses of the world! No mercy for the scum of the earth! HUMANITY IS OVERRATED! It's time to put NATURAL SELECTION & SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST back on tracks! Justice renders to everyone his due. Of all the lives in this world, apparently mine is the only one that�s meaningful. And that�s the truth . . . when you look at people today, you only see empty bodies, all dressed up and dolled up to the max but that is only the shell. Inside, it is empty. We only live to produce ourselves. We downright market ourselves. Every person wants to sell the product �I� as something wonderful, and because one person is dumber than the other, it works great. Whoever doesn�t want to go along with it, stands alone. I say: �Fuck you!�",1
SM,"Why do people have such a hard time taking things the way they are, I mean why don�t my parents, my aunt, or whoever else accept my Mohawk? Why do people not accept my appearance? They think to themselves: �Why can�t he run around normally?� But can you tell me what �normal� is? Is there a book or a homepage somewhere that commands you to act normal, including an explanation on what �normal� is? HARDLY LIKELY! SO, STOP WITH YOUR HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE Attitude and finally accept that: �Normal� is I! Everybody defines �normal� differently, everybody defines it for himself or herself! Is it too much to ask to be left alone? Are we condemned today, if we don�t want to know anything about anything, but rather want to live OUR lives? Yes! Because then the fucking cops come and bag you up! Own opinion . . . hasn�t been allowed anymore for a long time. Miserable state! Miserable planet! Miserable life! Shit!

You are sending your most hated place to hell! We don�t live in a democracy! We are well on our way to a dictatorship! Except for the brown4 fools in Dresden, we are surrounded by fascist pigs every day! If you compare today�s apparatus of state with Hitlers, then you will notice very quickly, that what they want to sell as politics here is old soup in new cans.

Shit, can you tell me where people rule? Every 4 years maybe, when we have the choice between shit, shit, and real shit? This fascist country needs riots and street fights, until this miserable government is overthrown! And essentially what did the SS, the SA do back then? They locked up people when they were against the government. And the cops today? They do the same! And then there would still be our beloved school ... to be compared to the Hitler Youth.

SM,"In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto. This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me. I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion. Some people will think this statement is hypocritical because of the nearly complete ethnic and cultural destruction brought to the Native Americans by our European ancestors, but this just reinforces my point. The natives didn�t take the invasion of Europeans seriously, and now what�s left is just a shadow of what was. My motives for this attack are not at all personal. Actually the Hispanic community was not my target before I read The Great Replacement.",2
SM,"This manifesto will cover the political and economic reasons behind the attack, my gear, my expectations of what response this will generate and my personal motivations and thoughts. In short, America is rotting from the inside out, and peaceful means to stop this seem to be nearly impossible. The inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing us for decades. They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history. The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations. I could write a ten page essay on all the damage these corporations have caused, but here is what is important. Due to the death of the baby boomers, the increasingly anti-immigrant rhetoric of the right and the ever increasing Hispanic population, America will soon become a one party-state.",2
SM,"The Democrat party will own America and they know it. They have already begun the transition by pandering heavily to the Hispanic voting bloc in the 1st Democratic Debate. They intend to use open borders, free healthcare for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political coup by importing and then legalizing millions of new voters. With policies like these, the Hispanic support for Democrats will likely become nearly unanimous in the future. The heavy Hispanic population in Texas will make us a Democrat stronghold. Losing Texas and a few other states with heavy Hispanic population to the Democrats is all it would take for them to win nearly every presidential election.",1
SM,"Although the Republican Party is also terrible. Many factions within the Republican Party are pro-corporation. Procorporation = pro-immigration. But some factions within the Republican Party don�t prioritize corporations over our future. So the Democrats are nearly unanimous with their support of immigration while the Republicans are divided over it. At least with Republicans, the process of mass immigration and citizenship can be greatly reduced. In short, immigration can only be detrimental to the future of America. Continued immigration will make one of the biggest issues of our time, automation, so much worse.",1
SM,"Some sources say that in under two decades, half of American jobs will be lost to it. Of course some people will be retrained, but most will not. So it makes no sense to keep on letting millions of illegal or legal immigrants flood into the United States, and to keep the tens of millions that are already here. Invaders who also have close to the highest birthrate of all ethnicities in America. In the near future, America will have to initiate a basic universal income to prevent widespread poverty and civil unrest as people lose their jobs. Joblessness in itself is a source of civil unrest. The less dependents on a government welfare system, the better.",2
SM,"The lower the unemployment rate, the better. Achieving ambitions social projects like universal healthcare and UBI would become far more likely to succeed if tens of millions of dependents are removed. Even though new migrants do the dirty work, their kids typically don�t. They want to live the American Dream which is why they get college degrees and fill higher-paying skilled positions. This is why corporations lobby for even more illegal immigration even after decades of it of happening. They need to keep replenishing the low-skilled labor pool. Even as migrant children flood skilled jobs, Corporations make this worse by lobbying for even more work visas to be issued for skilled foreign workers to come here. ",2
SM,"Recently, the senate under a REPUBLICAN administration has greatly increased the number of foreign workers that will take American jobs. Remember that both Democrats and Republicans support immigration and work visas. Corporations need to keep replenishing the labor pool for both skilled and unskilled jobs to keep wages down. So Automation is a good thing as it will eliminate the need for new migrants to fill unskilled jobs. Jobs that Americans can not survive on anyway. Automation can and would replace millions of low-skilled jobs if immigrants were deported. This source of competition for skilled labor from immigrants and visa holders around the world has made a very difficult situation even worse for natives as they compete in the skilled job market.",2
SM,"To compete, people have to get better credentials by spending more time in college. It used to be that a high school degree was worth something. Now a bachelor�s degree is what�s recommended to be competitive in the job market. The cost of college degrees has exploded as their value has plummeted. This has led to a generation of indebted, overqualified students filling menial, low paying and unfulfilling jobs. Of course these migrants and their children have contributed to the problem, but are not the sole cause of it. The American lifestyle affords our citizens an incredible quality of life. However, our lifestyle is destroying the environment of our country. The decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations.",2
SM,"Corporations are heading the destruction of our environment by shamelessly overharvesting resources. This has been a problem for decades. For example, this phenomenon is brilliantly portrayed in the decades old classic �The Lorax�. Water sheds around the country, especially in agricultural areas, are being depleted. Fresh water is being polluted from farming and oil drilling operations. Consumer culture is creating thousands of tons of unnecessary plastic waste and electronic waste, and recycling to help slow this down is almost non-existent. Urban sprawl creates inefficient cities which unnecessarily destroys millions of acres of land. We even use god knows how many trees worth of paper towels just wipe water off our hands.",2
SM,"Everything I have seen and heard in my short life has led me to believe that the average American isn�t willing to change their lifestyle, even if the changes only cause a slight inconvenience. The government is unwilling to tackle these issues beyond empty promises since they are owned by corporations. Corporations that also like immigration because more people means a bigger market for their products. I just want to say that I love the people of this country, but god damn most of y�all are just too stubborn to change your lifestyle.",2
SM,"So the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable. Main gun: AK47 � I realized pretty quickly that this isn�t a great choice since it�s the civilian version of the ak47. It�s not designed to shoot rounds quickly, so it overheats massively after about 100 shots fired in quick succession. I�ll have to use a heat-resistant glove to get around this. 8m3 bullet: This bullet, unlike pretty much any other 7.62_39 bullet, actually fragments like a pistol hollow point when shot out of an ak47 at the cost of penetration. ",2
SM,"Penetration is still reasonable, but not nearly as high as a normal ak47 bullet. The ak47 is definitely a bad choice without this bullet design, and may still be with it. Other gun Ar15 Pretty much any variation of this gun doesn�t heat up nearly as fast as the AK47.The round of this gun isn�t designed to fragment, but instead tumbles inside a target causing lethal wounding. This gun is probably better, but I wanted to explore different options. The ar15 is probably the best gun for military applications but this isn�t a military application. This will be a test of which is more lethal, either it�s fragmentation or tumbling. I didn�t spend much time at all preparing for this attack. Maybe a month, probably less.",2
SM,"I have do this before I lose my nerve. I figured that an under-prepared attack and a meh manifesto is better than no attack and no manifesto. Statistically, millions of migrants have returned to their home countries to reunite with the family they lost contact with when they moved to America. They come here as economic immigrants, not for asylum reasons. This is an encouraging sign that the Hispanic population is willing to return to their home countries if given the right incentive. An incentive that myself and many other patriotic Americans will provide. This will remove the threat of the Hispanic voting bloc which will make up for the loss of millions of baby boomers. This will also make the elites that run corporations realize that it�s not in their interest to continue piss off Americans.",1
SM,"Corporate America doesn�t need to be destroyed, but just shown that they are on the wrong side of history. That if they don�t bend, they will break. My whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn�t exist. The job of my dreams will likely be automated. Hispanics will take control of the local and state government of my beloved Texas, changing policy to better suit their needs. They will turn Texas into an instrument of a political coup which will hasten the destruction of our country. The environment is getting worse by the year. If you take nothing else from this document, remember this: INACTION IS A CHOICE.",1
SM,"I can no longer bear the shame of inaction knowing that our founding fathers have endowed me with the rights needed to save our country from the brink destruction. Our European comrades don�t have the gun rights needed to repel the millions of invaders that plaque their country. They have no choice but to sit by and watch their countries burn. America can only be destroyed from the inside-out. If our country falls, it will be the fault of traitors. This is why I see my actions as faultless. Because this isn�t an act of imperialism but an act of preservation.",1
SM,"America is full of hypocrites who will blast my actions as the sole result of racism and hatred of other countries, despite the extensive evidence of all the problems these invaders cause and will cause. People who are hypocrites because they support imperialistic wars that have caused the loss of tens of thousands of American lives and untold numbers of civilian lives. The argument that mass murder is okay when it is state sanctioned is absurd. Our government has killed a whole lot more people for a whole lot less.",1
SM,"Even if other non-immigrant targets would have a greater impact, I can�t bring myself to kill my fellow Americans. Even the Americans that seem hell-bent on destroying our country. Even if they are shameless race mixers, massive polluters, haters of our collective values, etc. One day they will see error of their ways. Either when American patriots fail to reform our country and it collapses or when we save it. But they will see the error of their ways. I promise y�all that.",1
SM,I am against race mixing because it destroys genetic diversity and creates identity problems. Also because it�s completely unnecessary and selfish. 2nd and 3rd generation Hispanics form interracial unions at much higher rates than average. Yet another reason to send them back. Cultural and racial diversity is largely temporary. Cultural diversity diminishes as stronger and/or more appealing cultures overtake weaker and/or undesirable ones. Racial diversity will disappear as either race mixing or genocide will take place. But the idea of deporting or murdering all non-white Americans is horrific.,1
SM,"Many have been here at least as long as the whites, and have done as much to build our country. The best solution to this for now would be to divide America into a confederacy of territories with at least 1 territory for each race. This physical separation would nearly eliminate race mixing and improve social unity by granting each race self-determination within their respective territory. My death is likely inevitable. If I�m not killed by the police, then I�ll probably be gunned down by one of the invaders. Capture in this case if far worse than dying during the shooting because I�ll get the death penalty anyway.",1
SM,"Worse still is that I would live knowing that my family despises me. This is why I�m not going to surrender even if I run out of ammo. If I�m captured, it will be because I was subdued somehow. Remember: it is not cowardly to pick low hanging fruit. AKA Don�t attack heavily guarded areas to fulfill your super soldier COD fantasy. Attack low security targets. Even though you might out gun a security guard or police man, they likely beat you in armor, training and numbers. Do not throw away your life on an unnecessarily dangerous target. If a target seems too hot, live to fight another day. My ideology has not changed for several years.",1
SM,"My opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president. I putting this here because some people will blame the President or certain presidential candidates for the attack. This is not the case. I know that the media will probably call me a white supremacist anyway and blame Trump�s rhetoric. The media is infamous for fake news. Their reaction to this attack will likely just confirm that. Many people think that the fight for America is already lost. They couldn�t be more wrong. This is just the beginning of the fight for America and Europe. I am honored to head the fight to reclaim my country from destruction.",1
SM,"Oh the happiness I could have had mingling among you hedonists, being counted as one of you, only if you didn�t fuck the living shit out of me. You could have been great. I could have been great.

I say we take up the cross, take up our guns and knives and hammers, and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath and last ounce of energy. Seer of Veracity. Seal of the Anti-Terrorist. Number of the Anti-Terrorist. You wanna rape us John Mark Karrs? You wanna rape us Debra LaFaves? Fuck you. By destroying we create. We create the feelings in you of what it is like to be the victim, what it is like to be fucked and destroyed.",2
SM,"Because of your annihilations, we create and raise new breeds of Children who will show you fuckers what you have done to us. Like Easter, it will be a day of rebirth. It will be a start of a revolution of the Children that you fucked. You have never felt a single ounce of pain your whole life, thus, by destroying you, by giving you pain, we attempt to show you responsibilities and meanings of other people�s lives. It�s grand for you to fuck us 24/7 for fun, but we can�t have a single minute of harmless playtime, only suffer. It�s dandy for you to rape us, but we�re not allowed to even speak, only be raped?",1
SM,"Fuck you. You love to pretend to, but you Hedonists, Charlatans, Sadists, Rapists, Terrorists will never know the feelings of giving up your lives for a cause. You have never felt a single ounce of pain in your hedonistic lives. You will never give up a single can of your Bud Light, a shot of your cognac, or a half-drop of your own precious blood for another human being, only fuck the shit out of him and lie afterwards. You fucked us, now we fuck you, now we kill you. There can be no lighter penalty for Masqueraded Democratic Terrorists who commit unforgivable acts of treason against mankind. There is no where in the world you can run, you Lovers of Terrorism. There is nowhere in the world you can hide, you Lovers of Sadism.",0
SM,"You will never know when and where the Weak and Defenseless that you fucked will strike � day, night, at school, in the public, in your home, during your most comfortable hour and protected place. You will never know how we will kill you � slash your throat, bullet in your back, torture you with knives, hammers, bolt cutters, scissors. You will always live in fear. You will never be able to go to school or work or rest or sleep. Your heart will always pound nonstop. Your sin-ridden soul will slowly eat up your conscious for the heinous crimes you have committed.",1
SM,"So if you don not want to die a painful death, do yourself a favor, do yourself a coup de grace, and kill yourself clean or you will endure pains you can never feel but with our hands. Kill yourself or we will hound you down and rip you, all your friends, and all your family into small pieces. We have no sympathy in killing humans who have no respect for other peoples lives.",1
SM,"Now that the slate has been cleaned and you have the world�s attention, the question is what are you going to do? Are you going to admit the truth or are you going to stand resolute on your mission to eternally fuck the Weak and the Defenseless and lie about it? Are you still going to use your power and manipulate the truth to end up with some sort of profit as you have always done? Are you going to skip over all the crimes you�ve committed and act as victims to the world so you can suck in millions of donation money to turn the situation into a profit? Your two million dollar house wasn�t enough? Your BMW wasn�t enough? Your inheritances weren�t enough? You have to fuck and steal from the Poor and the Weak who have nothing in order to gratify your fucking pride and hedonism? What are you going to do with the blood money? Buy a new Mercedes?",0
SM,"You want to brainwash your bratty, snobby kids that its right to steal from the poor, the Weak, and the Defenseless to always stay in power? The fat surpluses that you roll on everyday aren�t enough? Fuck you. Your answer rings loud and clear. I saw we take up the cross, Children of Ishmael, take up our guns and knives and any sharp objects, and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath and last ounce of energy. The blood of the Innocents should never be shed, but the wicked we shall spread our wings and strike. We do not want the Weak, the Defenseless, or the Innocent, but the sadistic, the corrupt, and the wicked who prey and rape from the Weak, the Defenseless, and the Innocent.",2
SM,"We will seek and demolish them until our last breath. You Lifetakers may have succeeded in raping our souls and shattering our dreams � but mark our words � the vendetta you have witnessed today will reverberate throughout every home and every soul in America and will inspire the Innocent kids that you have fucked to start a war of vendetta. We will raise hell on earth that the world has never witnessed. Millions of deaths and millions of gallons of blood on the streets will not quench the avenging phoenix that you have caused us to unleash. Generation after generation, we martyrs, like Eric and Dylan, will sacrifice our lives to fuck you thousand folds for what you Apostles of Sin have done to us.",1
SM,"Pain of every atom between air and water, sky and ground, heaven and hell, life and death wouldn�t begin to explain the experience that we went through under your wrath. What did you expect me to do, you violators of human rights? As the time approached, I wished for a last minute miracle and discard this mission you�ve given me. Heaven knows I wouldn�t hurt a single leaf of a flower. But when the time came, I did it. I had to. What other choices did you give me? All this time.. . You never know that a human being is capable of doing until you fuck him to the edge. When you�re raped of everything, you got nothing to lose. If you have a single milligram of conscience, a grain of integrity, a speck of heart, you will kill yourself for all the lives you have brutally extinguished.

In life and death and spirit. We�ll soon be together.",1
SM,"Let the revolution begin! Die you Descendants of Satan! Fuck you, and die now! I am Ax Ishmael. I am the Anti-Terrorist of America. Are you happy now that you have destroyed my life? Now that you have stolen everything you could from me? Now that you have gone on a 9/11 on my life like fucking Osama. Now that you have fucked your own people like fucking Kim Jong-Il. Now that you have gone on a hummer safari on my life like fucking Bush? Are you happy now?",0
SM,"It seems like an irrelevant question to be concerned about. No one can obtain knowledge about what happens after death, nor if anything is required to do for the deceased. If some ritual was necessary, no one could know about it nor have any knowledge about the requirements of it. Perhaps there's a magical platypus who requires that you burn a wooden effigy of a hamster so that the deceased can ride it to the gates of Valhalla. From observing other people who have died, the only conclusion which can be reached is that nothing happens.",1
SM,"Treating death as if it's the end of everything would be the most prudent course of action because believing that something happens is contrary to the observable world of the life which you are certain about having, thus deluding you into behaving in a way which could negatively impact your life. It's uncommon for high-quality ammunition to hang fire. If he was using the same cheap cartridges for his massacre, then the bullets were likely full metal jacketed. Beyond that, his 9mm Beretta Cx4 Storm innately wasn't a particularly effective firearm. The difference in velocity between a 9mm rifle and 9mm pistol is usually 15% at best.",1
SM,"The benefits which a 9mm rifle has for a novice are basically its reduced recoil and greater distance between the front and rear sights. It allows faster and more accurate shots, although that was inconsequential for Kimveer Gill if he was aiming as poorly as I assume he was. You believe that a degenerate capitalistic system results in a commodification of sexuality. This enables the creation of a cultural notion that premarital sexuality is acceptable. This results in sexuality becoming widespread.",1
SM,"This has three primary consequences: The first is that there are some males who believe that the existence of this attitude of sexuality is a justification of date rape, which causes instances of it to increase. The second is that the existence of this attitude destroys the significance of marriages. Fewer people get married, and of the people who do get married, more divorce. The third is that the prevalence of sexuality results in more abortions, and more unwanted children, than would otherwise result.",1
SM,"You believe that it would be desirable to outlaw premarital sex to cause a gradual cultural shift away from all of this. And I would like you to briefly elaborate on something so that I can better understand your position. What is it about marriage that appeals to you, and why do you oppose the prevalence of divorces? It seems bizarre to be concerned about the consent of animals in zoophilic relationships considering that millions of animals are slaughtered each day.",1
SM,"The best movie I've seen about a mass shooting was from Lifetime. Other than the issue of portraying Richard Farley as a cute engineer instead of a creepy technician, its immense amount of accurate details warrants its ""based on a true story"" status. For anyone who doesn't know, Sabratha was part of a group which created an excellent school shooting movie.",2
SM,"One of the major reasons why Columbine is still a relatively popular topic in recent years is because of the potential it allows for speculation. This would not exist if they had lived because their actual thoughts and experiences, the contents of the basement tapes/Nixon tape, and everything like that would probably be well-known. I don't like holidays, but I would say Halloween. It marks the beginning of my favorite time of the year, November-December, when the sunlight always seems to be its dimmest. Because of the snow, January and February always seem to be intolerably bright. I hate the sun so much. In any event, it's neat that Halloween is the only widely-observed holiday which sort of has the potential to be tied to despair.",2
SM,"YouTube has a zero-tolerance policy for Columbine videos because of Pekka Auvinen. You might not have centipedes in your house, but I'm sure you have more types of spiders, snakes, and giant ants than I can count, box jellyfish lurking somewhere in the refrigerator, and wombats roaming the halls. Guns? I've got all the guns I need. I can imagine his mother trying to wash his pants and finding his 50-round TEC-9 magazine in one of the pockets.",0
SM,"So you can sacrifice it as a part of your Satanic rituals? Females generally kill in a more personal context than males do, so I would expect there to have not been explosives, and the target selection would have been less random. There have been a lot of mass murders committed by females, but they almost always take the form of familicide. At least 98% of indiscriminate rampage killers are male. Therapists are secular priests who assert that they have some ""truth"", and if your values deviate, then you are ""wrong"". Hence, The Rapist.",1
SM,"They impose their values onto you through their mindfucking. You mean to say you haven't seen any of tyler's trolling? He's obviously boasting about how he would have gone on a rampage by that time and would have subsequently died. He was ignored because it happened on an Indian reservation and everyone was freaking out about whether or not Terry Schiavo should continue to flop around. Conservatives really piss me off. Actually, everyone does. I never dress up. Clothes are for slaves to civilization.",0
SM,"I saw God Told Me To yesterday. My gaydar indicated that the Charlie clone couldn't have killed his wife before climbing the water tower. There were several other mass murders, but even ignoring that entire aspect, the rest of the movie itself was a lot more enjoyable than I anticipated. And as a side-note, early on in the movie, it was rumored that all of the murderers had been seen with a man in his early 20s who had shoulder-length blond hair. More evidence that Martin Bryant was framed?",1
SM,"All tattoos, all piercings, all body modifications including shaving, and all clothes themselves are cultural delusions. I can't stop thinking about how much this song annoys me. Even if it wasn't so lame, it would still bother me that they used the name ""Robert"". Now one of my favorite mass shooters has been turned into a trendy stereotypical poster child of school shootings just because of his age, despite having nothing to do with the school shooter archetype. They could have used Michael, or Evan, or Barry, which would literally fit in with the whole ""cowboy kid"" thing.",1
SM,"People who are likely to sexually harass are going to seek pornography. Instead of treating poornography as an external force which floats around trying to corrupt people from some allegedly-ideal set of behavior, why not ask where a desire for pornography comes from? Pornography exists as a coping mechanism for an artificial scarcity of sex. And where does sexual harassment come from? Sexual harassment is a retaliation against, once again, an artificial scarcity of sex. Stigmatizing sex and then being aghast that there are consequences is a classic case of having one's cake and wanting to eat it, too.",0
SM,"I don't think there should be any age of consent, but since no matter what I say everyone will accuse me of just wanting to justify some latent pedophilia I allegedly have, I will only say that you need to be attracted to prepubescents to be considered a pedophile. A 50-year-old who is attracted to pubescent 12-year-olds is not a pedophile; a 16-year-old who is attracted to 8-year-olds is a pedophile. Serial killers are lame. Everyone knows that mass murderers are the cool kids. If I found the irony of this kind of statutory rape/child support nonsense in fiction, I would dismiss it as being too excessively implausible to effectively serve as satire.",1
SM,"Culture. I've been pissed out of my mind all night thinking about it. I should have been born a chimp. I would even settle for a post-language hunter-gatherer society. Enculturing human children is already terrifying enough, but enculturing other apes is something out of the cruelest nightmare. I don't know of anything more worthy of crying over. Rest in peace, little buddy. You're free from the rape of civilization now.",1
SM,"I should call in on John Zerzan's radio program about Travis. I'm really surprised that I haven't been able to find anything he's written or said about the incident, considering how often he brings up random acts of violence. It seems like Travis would be a poster-chimp of his philosophy. This doesn't seem at all notable as far as ""school violence"" goes compared to when that guy beheaded that other student at Virginia Tech.",0
SM,"I hate every facet of language, along with the entire concept of aesthetics. I spent all day ruminating over how much I hate culture. Now I've calmed down and am left lying on the floor, numbly perplexed over the foreign concept of loving life. Any place and any time before language infected humans. Don't bother. I barely play any video games, let alone any modern ones, but I bought it because it was being universally described as the most immersive virtual world to have ever existed. In actuality, every aspect of the game is designed solely around the facilitation of its mindless combat system. I was so disappointed that I got 6000 words into typing a review lambasting everything about it until I realized that my disappointment was my fault for being so foolish as to allow myself to be excited, especially over something that I should have known would be awful.",2
SM,"This is the only massacre I can think of where the amount injured was significantly higher than in the initial reports, instead of the normal drastic reduction. Today I dreamt a Columbine reference for the first time. I've probably never had one before because I've scarcely ever cared about Columbine. I began my dream by waking up at age 14 in my extremely dark bedroom during a power outage. I knew that there were ghoulies outside my locked door, roaming around the rest of the house. I tried to get my pocket flashlight to work, but it wasn't consistently staying on.",1
SM,"Replacement batteries didn't help, so I instead tried using my backup flashlight: a partially-filled roll of dimes. I spent a while fumbling around with loose dimes, trying to fill up the roll, and eventually ""my brother"" came up to the other side of the locked door. He told me that he needed my help with the ghoulies. I was saying, ""Oh, fuck off. I know you're not my brother. You yourself are one of the ghoulies"", as I was continuing to fumble around trying to fill the roll of dimes. I ended up not having enough dimes to entirely fill it, but at least I had enough for it to give off a dim ray of light.",1
SM,"I got out of bed and prepared for a fight with the ghoulies. I went downstairs as my flashlight dreamvanished, but at this point the rest of the house was dimly lit anyway. As I was about to go into the kitchen, a huge purple monster with long arms leapt forth from around a corner and pinned me against a wall. It sort of looked like this: http://www.raukusbaukus.com/images/grap ... ilcher.jpg I realized that it was some student I knew when I was 12. He tried talking to me, and basically said something to the extent of, ""Everyone picked on me for being a huge purple monster, and so now I'm going to go Columbine.",1
SM,"I already went to a bunch of other kids' houses to find a partner, but they refused my offer, so I ate them. You're next on the list. Do you want to join me?"". The way it apparently worked was that I could get bitten by him and then choose which form I wanted to be in at will. I thought, why not get bitten by him so I could become a cool purple monster whenever I pleased, and then just use my new monster powers to kill him right after he bites me? So I was like, ""Sure, bro"".",1
SM,"He kept trying to bite different parts of me, but it always ended in me whining, ""Ooowwwwww"", he would let go, look at the spot, and say, ""I didn't bite long enough! It didn't work"". We went through this for quite a while, and then I had the thought that, ""You shouldn't just bite me -anywhere-. It should be high up on my arm so people don't see the mark, the same reason why doctors inject patients on their arm dream logic. He rolled up my sleeve, pointed at my vein, and I said, ""No! Doctors would find out because they inject there, of course! It has to be higher"".",1
SM,"He kept pointing to various places as we were walking around the house, but none of them seemed suitable to me. He gradually dream-changed into having an awfully-constructed syringe in his hand with all sorts of bent needles all over it, and I procrastinated by getting him to talk about the music he liked. I had decided at this point that I should just kill him rather than wait to get turned into a cool therianthrope because his needles were really starting to freak me out. Then I realized, ""Hey, if you were feigning my brother's voice, then that means you must have killed him!""",2
SM,"I ran down to the basement as he was assuring me he hadn't done anything, and I saw my brother soundly asleep. I went back up the stairs and saw an opportunity to kill the huge purple monster, seeing as he had transformed into a cardboard box. I shred apart the box as dawn approached while he was complaining about how confusing I was. ""All the other students just screamed at me, but you accepted me, and now what are you doing? You're tearing me apart!"", and I told him to shut up or something like that as I tore apart the last bit of cardboard. My brother walked up the stairs, but it wasn't really him!",2
SM,"He had been brainwashed into believing that he was someone else from my childhood, whom I'll call Billy, and he had even been made up to look sort of like him. I asked him who he thought he was, and sure enough he said Billy, and that he was moving away to college. I followed him into the garage, trying to find a way to convince him that he wasn't Billy before it was too late. Once I entered the garage, my nonexistent kindergarten-age sister was blocking my path while crying for some reason. I affectionately embraced her in my arms and tenderly kissed her. She woefully said, ""I don't want you to kiss me"" as her crying got worse.",1
SM,"I was annoyed that she had been brainwashed into thinking there was something evil about kissing, so I picked her up and tossed her over the railing into a pile of cardboard boxes several feet below. Heroically getting back to the task at hand, I looked out at the open garage door, where there were all sorts of non-existent relatives assembling outside in the full-blown morning. There was some fictional high-status male family member at the garage door reading from a scroll in his hands. He was giving the eulogy for my ""dead"" brother!",1
SM,"There were some assorted people in the garage who were walking toward the outside, and I saw that among them were two pastors. My horror movie experience indicated that pastors help with all sorts of ghoulie problems, so I called them over and explained that my brother wasn't actually dead. They were shocked and agreed to help stop the ceremony. One of them followed me toward the eulogizer, but at this point, the garage was significantly larger and was extremely crowded, to the extent where I couldn't even pass anyone. Everyone stopped walking as they turned to look behind us at someone who was walking forward.",1
SM,"It was apparently her birthday, so the only logical thing to do was hum the wedding march. The pastor and I sighed as we hummed with them, waiting for them to move forward again. The song ended, she stopped, and said, ""I'm glad that you're all here today"". Various views of multiple explosions went through my mind, and at the end of it, a thirdperson overhead stationary view showed some WASPs in a residential park doing all sorts of recreational activities. Text appeared saying, ""At least now there was plenty of space for racquetball"".",2
SM,"I realized that I had been watching a YouTube video, part 11/11. I thought, ""Wow, that was a pretty surreal movie. I'm bookmarking this and I'll go back to look at the other parts later"". I woke up in real life and realized that YouTube would remove the videos from their website along with all internet references to them by the time that I managed to get online, so I typed this for posterity.",2
SM,"The power trips that you describe are going to be so prominent because of the entire philosophy behind education: the brutal indoctrination of pristine minds so as to propagate some delusional system of cultural values. Is it really so ideal to have good and efficient citizens? All they'll do is be more effective at propagating the system you hate. Power trips and bullying are just symptoms, not the disease itself. Literature is simply another coping mechanism for children who've been mindfucked by culturapists.",2
SM,"They're carried to other worlds in the stream of semen. Well, I feel schizophrenic. How many American women in this decade never remove their body hair? I can't find practically anything on it, and the implication seems to be that it's around 1%. Value is such a crazy thing. I hate going through these extremely rare instances of wild mood swings that I have. I think this was the only time this year for me.",1
SM,"I was as depressed as I get during my last post, and I'm fine with the interminable depression that I normally have, but now I'm incoherently giddy with glee. Well, relative to my baseline... Except now that I'm giddy, I can't really say that I hate it because I think everything is delightful. If depressives cut themselves to feel better, I wonder what cutting a happy-go-lucker would do.",1
SM,"Santa's supposed to be jolly. I hope he visits me tonight so I can find out. Pfft, goals are artificial impositions of deprivation. I'm content to mope on the floor 24/7. I don't have any clue what transhumanists are thinking. Civilization isn�t something which just happens to gently exist without us having to do anything, because every newborn child � human child � is born in a chimp-like state, and civilization is only sustained by conditioning them for years on end so that they�ll accept it for what it is.",2
SM,"And since we�ve gone through this conditioning, we can observe a human family raising a human child, and I�m sure that even you have trouble intuitively seeing it as something unnatural, but when we see a chimp in that position, we know that there�s something profoundly wrong with the situation. And it�s easy to say there�s something wrong with it simply because it�s a chimp, but what�s the real difference between us and our closest relatives? Travis wasn�t an untamed monster at all.",1
SM,"Um, he wasn�t just feigning domestication, he was civilized. Um, he was able to integrate into society, he was a chimp actor when he was younger, and his owner drove him around the city frequently in association with her towing business, where he met many different people, and got along with everyone. If Travis had been some nasty monster all his life, it would have been widely reported, but to the contrary, it seems like everyone who knew him said how shocked they were that Travis had been so savage, because they knew him as a sweet child.",1
SM,"And � there were two isolated incidents early in his life when he acted aggressively, but summarizing them would take too long, so basically I�ll just say that he didn�t act really any differently than a human child would, and the people who would use that as an indictment against having chimps live as humans do wouldn�t apply the same thing to humans, so it�s just kind of irrelevant.",1
SM,"But anyway, look what civilization did to him: it had the same exact effect on him as it has on humans. He was profoundly sick, in every sense of the term, and he had to resort to these surrogate activities like watching baseball, and looking at pictures on a computer screen, and taking Xanax. He was a complete mess. And his attack wasn�t simply because he was a senselessly violent, impulsive chimp. Um, which was how his behavior was universally portrayed.",2
SM,"Um, immediately before his attack, he had desperately been wanting his owner to drive him somewhere, and the best reason I can think of for why he would want that, looking at his entire life, would be that some little thing he experienced was the last straw, and he was overwhelmed by the life that he had, and he wanted to get out of it by changing his environment, and the best way that he knew how to deal with that was by getting his owner to drive him somewhere else.",1
SM,"And when his owner�s � owner�s friend arrived, he knew that she was trying to coax him back into his life of domestication, and he couldn�t handle that, so � he attacked her, and anyone else who approached them. And dismissing his attack as simply being the senseless violence and impulsiveness of a chimp, instead of a human, is wishful thinking at best. His attack can be seen entirely parallel to the attacks and random acts of violence that you bring up on your show every week committed by humans, which the mainstream also has no explanation for, and actual humans, I just don�t think it would be such a stretch to say that he very well could have been a teenage mall shooter or something like that.",1
SM,"About the images � they�re not exactly like the ones in that movie, but that�s the best I can do to display an example of them. It�s not the normal screamer type of pop-up for me; the faces are fairly mundane, and they sporadically rapidly appear without any context and then disappear. When it happens and I get slightly paranoid over them , I usually go straight to my bedroom and try to sleep; I don�t even bother to brush my teeth first because the bathroom�s window only has partial drapes and I don�t like being around exposed windows during it.",2
SM,"It sounds pathetic, but when I get into my bedroom after it happens, I search it to determine that there�s no one in there with me, and then feel better knowing that the only route someone could take is through the closed door. I�ve occasionally felt uncomfortable about looking at the gap between the windows and their synthetic drapes. Getting back to the subject of paranoia � those images were the worst �hallucinations� I had experienced until a couple of weeks ago late one night when I was getting very tired.",1
SM,"The incident was so surreal that I only a remember a small amount of the details. Basically, I began to �see� many different things. Although I knew that none of it was actually real, it came as close to being real as it could for me without it being physically tangible. I heard screaming around me, and I had an overwhelming sense that there was someone dead behind me. I kept seeing silhouettes of flickering people everywhere. I felt like I had to cry. The entire ordeal persisted for about fifteen minutes and sort of faded away. Prior to it happening, I had never had that sort of delusional hysteria before. It was possibly the strangest thing I�ve ever experienced.",2
SM,"Basically, I take the belief that everyone should have equal rights and apply it consistently. I�ve had these thoughts for years and haven�t spoken to anyone about them. I�d like to be able to discuss this in a topic, but it will probably be too offensive. I�m going to keep it to myself for now. And now that I think about it, this might sound a bit satirical, but it�s not.",2
SM,"Anyway, this is what I would have posted: Ever since I was 14, the entire subject of gay rights which is so pervasive in this society has frustrated me. It�s not owing to any malice I have toward homosexuals, but instead is caused by the absurdity of the overwhelming fervor against the discrimination of homosexuals while there is another class of people who genuinely suffer from persecution for their lifestyle. While many people celebrate homosexual relationships, sexual relationships between adults and children are universally condemned and vilified.",0
SM,"Every adult who is known to have been involved in one is automatically branded for life as a violent and dangerous rapist. Anyone who is unfortunate enough to be subjected to this societal corruption endures the effects of it for the rest of their lives: their personal information is widely divulged to their neighbors as if public castigation is encouraged; they are denied employment; their location must be reported to their oppressive government; whether or not an adult engages in a sexual relationship with a child, they must forever hide their mere sexuality or else be stigmatized infinitely beyond anything homosexuals endure.",2
SM,"If any of this applied to homosexuals, the public would be appalled, yet no one cares when it applies to pedophiles. It seemed as if the entire country was outraged when Tyler Clementi killed himself a couple months ago. From what I know, the catalyst for his suicide was the way that he had been mocked after being recorded by a hidden camera while he was engaging in sexual activity with another male.",2
SM,"Yet To Catch A Predator, a television program which was based on the manipulation of hundreds of adults into being recorded by hidden cameras after desiring sexual activity with children, has never received anywhere near this level of outrage. The audience is supposed to find entertainment value in the humiliation of ephebophiles were afterward violently subdued by police and impounded, having the rest of their lives impacted significantly greater than anything Tyler Clementi had experienced.",1
SM,"There was scarcely any criticism when one of the ephebophiles was forced into shooting himself in the head as police were surrounding him. There is an inordinate amount of innately fallacious arguments against pedophilia, most of which are also directed toward homosexuality. I�m not going to address any of them to begin with because I assume everyone here already understands that arguments such as �The DSM recognizes pedophilia as a mental illness� or �pedophilia is unnatural� are ludicrously invalid.",2
SM,"For this first post, I�m only going to address arguments which are remotely coherent. If anyone invokes more ignorant ones, I will address them later in this topic. I�m not sure how well I�ll be able to do this preemptively, though, because I don�t entirely understand the mindset of people who disparage pedophilia as a sexuality. From my perspective, it�s like trying to argue against someone who believes that females are inferior to males. It�s a patently absurd notion, and I find it to be sort of comical that I even have to make this argument.",1
SM,"To begin with, you must understand that pedophiles are not the only victims of this virulent persecution. The children who choose to engage in sexual relationships with adults are invariably severed from their loving relationships and are indoctrinated into believing that they have been abused, being labeled as �victims� and being subjected to the genuinely abusive will of psychiatrists (the most immoral profession I can imagine) who �treat� (coerce) them into believing that they can overcome their �abuse�.",1
SM,"I don�t understand how this can be perceived as being fundamentally any different from the nature of the mental abuse which is used to indoctrinate political dissidents. Children would not be �scarred� by their voluntary sexual experiences any more than adults in typical sexual relationships would be �scarred� unless their society shamed them into believing that they should feel guilty. The reason why a child would be mentally damaged after having consented to sexual activity is because they are socially conditioned into believing that what they did is in some ill-defined way deleterious. This is no different than submitting to oppressive religious beliefs that premarital sexual activity should be viewed negatively, and that anyone who engages in it should feel shame and remorse for having committed their sins.",1
SM,"I assume everyone here understands that there is nothing innately pernicious about the nature of sexual relationships between adults, and that there is nothing innately immoral about sexuality in general, yet somehow sexual activity inexplicably becomes a pestilence once children engage in it. This argument is the equivalent of saying that the sexual activity of unmarried couples is harmful, yet the sexual activity of married couples is neutral, or even virtuous. It�s completely nonsensical. The morality of the sexuality of children should not be evaluated any differently than the morality of the sexuality of adults.",1
SM,"The specious propaganda which is primarily disseminated against the legitimacy of sexual relationships between adults and children is that a child is incapable of consenting to sexual activity, so any occurrence of it is inherently rape. This is an arbitrary assumption which oppresses children and is an indication of the abusive mentality which is inflicted upon them daily in this society, dehumanizing them and relegating them to the status of slaves. Why is sexual activity considered to be incomprehensible to a child? What is so fundamentally challenging about the concept that there is not a single child who could possibly fathom it?",2
SM,"It�s absurd for to claim that sexuality is something which requires significant mental capabilities and thus must be violently controlled by governments, because there is no restriction against imbeciles being sexual. Children are innately incapable of comprehending it, yet once someone attains a certain age (which varies extremely depending on the time period and location, thus demonstrating that it�s absolutely meaningless), everyone is suddenly capable of it? If the nature of sexuality is fundamentally a concept to understand for all children, then it is not reasonable to assume that even a small minority of people are capable of comprehending its perplexity at 18.",1
SM,"If an adult may engage in sexual activity because they are demonstratively capable of employing prudent rationality, then why may a child not enjoy the same right? Professing that a child is incapable of understanding the concept of consent because of the belief that adults are universally �more rational� than they are, and thus they do not deserve to control their bodies, is equivalent to claiming that females do not deserve to control their bodies because males are �more judicious in personal affairs� in relation to them, or some other such inane fatuity. It�s a senseless and morally reproachful position to hold.",1
SM,"There is the argument that the �power disparity� in the relationship between an adult and a child renders any sexuality between them to be inherently abusive. This notion can be applied against females, arguing that they cannot be in a sexual relationship because many of them explicitly desire one with a male who is in a higher position of societal �power�, thus none of them are capable of giving consent. No none believes that a pretentious �power disparity� argument applies to the legitimacy of sexual relationships between adults, yet it arbitrarily applies to children? It is also outright fallacious because the child has all of the control over the relationship. The adult would have to be extremely careful around the child because virtually everyone would accuse the adult of raping the child without consideration as to whether or not s/he gave consent.",0
SM,"Some of you may say that children would never consent to sexual activity, and that if they engage in it, an adult must have forced them into it. Apply this argument to females once again and it immediately evinces why this is a meaningless assertion. It is equivalent to asserting that violent persecution is justified toward any female and her associate who engages in premarital sexual activity because no females would ever desire it owing to some arbitrary criterion. It�s a presumptuous way to justify discriminatory coercion and is not based on any logical argument.",1
SM,"Personally, I don�t understand why children in general would want to be sexual, but I also don�t understand why adults in this society are so sexual. If I was ever going to engage in any sexual activity, I would be certain that it would be meaningful, but adults everywhere engage in it as if it doesn�t matter. Adults seem to invariably claim that it is �making love� or some other haphazard justification of their licentious behavior. In that case, how can you define what is and is not a legitimate expression of love?",0
SM,"If you believe that adults �making love� can be described as positively as I constantly hear it is, then the sexual activity of children is equally positive. Why is this society so adamantly opposed to pedophilia? Children deserve all of the rights and respects that an adult should receive, yet this is not the case to any extent. The inexorable battery of children (�spanking�) is fully legal in the United States.",2
SM,"Children�s free will is suppressed and annihilated in every conceivable manner within families. Beyond having their associations, location, and every action subject to their parents� wills, they are denied their own thoughts, opinions, values, and religion, and instead are coerced into adopting their parents�. Within the rest of society, children are denied property, their parents instantly legally siphon it from their children�s domain regardless of how the child obtained it, employment, and are denied the right to have even an token impact on the government which innately subjugates them through its very existence, although I�ll spare you from my anarchistic rhetoric in this post.",2
SM,"Children are not even allowed to control their own bodies: if an adult wants to force any medical procedures or treatments onto a child, the child does not have any choice in the matter. This is why children are forced into being ashamed of their sexuality and why adults are violently persecuted for loving children. If pedophilic relationships were condoned, then it would be a recognition that children have human rights, which this egregious society is not capable of accepting. Children deserve all of the rights and respects that adults should receive, yet they do not because this morally reprehensible society implicitly enjoys the abusive subjugation of them as sub-human property instead of as people who have their own legitimate thoughts and desires.",1
SM,"If you support civil rights, such as through being a feminist or a LGBTQ activist, you should oppose the violent persecution of pedophilic relationships and the subjugation of children. The right of children to have sexual relationships is a small step toward liberating them from the oppression of adults which they currently endure.",1
SM,"I wasn�t intending on posting anything about this topic because I don�t think that anyone would consider an alternative perspective about which I still have very little faith, but the recent removal of that book from Amazon has irritated me. I�ve barely read any information about the book or its removal, so I don�t know anything about its contents, but it was probably completely benign. It doesn�t matter either way, though, because it would have been removed under any circumstance merely because of the nature of its subject. While it seems like nearly everyone wants the and anything like it to not be available through Amazon�s website, the motive of the very few people who oppose its removal is nothing other harrowing. According to them, it�s inappropriate for Amazon to not support the free speech of authors.",2
SM,"These people use the same mentality and reasoning for the justification of the availability of material pertaining to nuisances such as racial supremacy, as if pedophilia is something that is equivalently morally repugnant; as if the existence of information pertaining to it should merely be grudgingly tolerated rather than supported as something which can be positive. I don�t have an moral opposition to a book which directs adults on how they can safely have a relationship with children: I condone its availability.",2
SM,"Information like that needs to be available because any beauty which could potentially be present in such relationships is currently violently suppressed. I support anyone, child or adult, who believe that their love is important enough to be in a relationship together and risk the current consequences, because I believe that nothing is more important than love. Those who seek the application of violence to suppress these relationships are the depraved profligates, not the individuals who seek to express their love regardless of age.",2
SM,"I know that I will be accused of desiring sexual contact with children, and there might possibly be accusations that I have already had it, but neither case is true. I also have not seen any degree of child pornography nor intentionally seen any adult pornography. All of the sexuality which is rampant in this society in general is as disgusting to me as pedophilia is, but that isn�t sufficient reason for me to desire the violent persecution of anyone over it because of personal perspective. I�m pretty confused when it comes to my sexuality, but I�m certain that I�m not a pedophile.",2
SM,"My wet dream is living in the wild with apes, and theirs is living in a computer with AI. What's the mindset behind transhumanism? What is ""chemical imbalance"" even supposed to mean? Why don't hunter-gatherers need antidepressants? I swear, a psychiatrist could take a perfectly fine chimpanzee away from its jungle, confine it in captivity, and when the chimp gets depressed, they would say, ""This chimpanzee has a chemical imbalance. What? A correlation between enculturation and depression? But culture brings us meaning and beauty. Get out of my way, cavemanwannabe. I need to prescribe this chimp some Xanax"".",1
SM,"I entirely recognize that value is a delusion. I'm not condemning them: I genuinely want to understand why they love technology. I can't at all relate to why they desire even more civilization than the amount that's already been imposed onto them. Only if you factor in infant mortality, but that's even more of an indication why they should be needing antidepressants, not the opposite. And yet somehow, it's we domesticated humans that need antidepressants while hunter-gatherers are the happy ones.",1
SM,"I hate how I spend 99% of my time upset about culture, when life itself is the problem. Culture just adds insult to injury. In any event, it's myopic to telescope on school shootings when they've comprised a small percentage of the larger trend of mass murders, which are carried out in all sorts of contexts; but they always occur in contexts which involve some permutation of alienation, which has been part and parcel with societal """"progress"""".",1
SM,"This relationship can be seen with the Chinese mass stabbings. There were some sparse incidents throughout the 20th century, but the rate began to rise in the 1990s and erupted in the early 2000s, corresponding to China's rapid """"economic development"""", culminating in the infamous spate of elementary school stabbings of 2010. American mass murders were less prevalent before Richard Speck precipitated their rise in 1966. My best estimate for the -absolute- minimum amount of mass murders in the US since 1966 is 960. I would be surprised if there weren't a minimum of somewhere around 1500 in reality, but we'll just vaguely say that there have been over 1000.",2
SM,"If you were trying to measure alienation in a society, what could be a more blatant indication? And it's glib to dismiss them as not being indicative of anything just because there have been over a thousand of them instead of over a hundred thousand, or however many you think are necessary, because mass murdering is so ridiculously over-the-top of a response that very few people are prone to do it under any circumstances.",1
SM,"But just look at how many fans you can find for all different types of mass murderers��""not just the Reb & VoDkA bunch��"", and beyond these fans are countless more people who can sympathize with them; and beyond these are millions more who never think of relating the circumstances of their lives to anyone else but instead just go through the motions of life incessantly dissatisfied with their environment. Thinking of this society as the default state of existence is the reason why you think that humans would be """"not well"""" for """"no reason whatsoever"""".",0
SM,"Civilization has not been present for 99% of the existence of hominids, and the only way that it's ever sustained is by indoctrinating each new child for years on end. The """"wellness"""" that you speak of is solely defined by a child's submission to this process and their subsequent capacity to propagate civilization themselves. When civilization exists in a form where all forms of alienation are rampant, as can be seen in the most recent incarnation within the last fifty years which AS55 talked about, new children will end up """"not well"""" in all sorts of ways.",0
SM,You don't even have to touch a topic as cryptic as mass murder to see an indication of this: you can look at a single symptom as egregious as the proliferation of antidepressants. And look in your own life. You've said that you're afflicted by unrelenting anxiety and that you're afraid to leave your house. Do you really think that the way you feel is not symptomatic of anything other than your own inexplicable defectiveness?,1
SM,"My first act of preparation was the purchase my first handgun. I did this quickly and hastily, at a local gun shop called Goleta Gun and Supply. I had already done some research on handguns, and I decided to purchase the Glock 34 semiautomatic pistol, an efficient and highly accurate weapon. I signed all ofthe papers and was told that my pickup day was in mid-December. That fell in nicely, because that was when I was planning on staying till. After I picked up the handgun, I brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power. I was now armed.",2
SM,"Well, this is my last video, it has all had to come to this. Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, against all of you. For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I�ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me. Girls gave their affection, and sex and love to other men but never to me. I�m 22 years old and I�m still a virgin. I�ve never even kissed a girl. I�ve been through college for two and a half years, more than that actually, and I�m still a virgin. It has been very torturous.",2
SM,"College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure. Within those years, I�ve had to rot in loneliness. It�s not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don�t know why you girls aren�t attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It�s an injustice, a crime, because . . . I don�t know what you don�t see in me. I�m the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman. I will punish all of you for it. On the day of retribution I�m going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB. And I will slaughter every spoiled, stuck-up, blond slut I see inside there.",1
SM,"All those girls I have desired so much, they would have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man if I ever made a sexual advance towards them while they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes. I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am in truth the superior one. The true alpha male. Yes. After I have annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I will take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there.",1
SM,"All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasures while I�ve had to rot in loneliness for all these years. They�ve all looked down upon me every time I tried to go out and join them, they�ve all treated me like a mouse. Well now I will be a god compared to you. You will all be animals. You are animals and I will slaughter you like animals. And I will be a god. Exacting my retribution on all those who deserve it. You do deserve it. Just for the crime of living a better life than me. All you popular kids, you�ve never accepted me, and now you will all pay for it. And girls, all I ever wanted was to love you, and to be loved by you.",1
SM,"I have wanted a girlfriend, I have wanted sex, I have wanted love, affection, adoration. You think I am unworthy of it. That is a crime that can never be forgiven. If I can not have you, girls, I will destroy you. You denied me a happy life, and in turn, I will deny all of you life. It is only fair. I hate all of you. Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power, I would stop at nothing [points finger at camera] to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood. And rightfully so. You deserve to be annihilated and I will give that to you.",1
SM,"You never showed me any mercy and so I will show you none. Who�s the alpha male now, bitches? I thought to myself, regarding all of the girls who�ve looked down on me in the past. I quickly admired my new weapon before locking it up in my safe and preparing to go back to my hometown for the winter break. I didn�t attend the Lemelson�s Christmas party that year, nor would I ever again.",1
SM,"The only person I ever really hung out with at those parties was James, and James was no longer my friend. It would have been extremely awkward to be there while James is there, knowing that the two of us, who used to be old friends since first grade, would be avoiding each other. It would be a foul and bitter experience, and I had already gone through enough anguish in the last few months. I remained in my hometown for a couple of weeks, and then I went back, the place of beauty and romance that I�ve had to suffer in lonely hell. I only signed up for online classes for the Spring semester, but that was only to placate my parents.",1
SM,"I didn not see the point in even bothering with college anymore. Having to walk through SBCC with all of those beautiful girls strutting around in their revealing shorts, showing off their sexy legs. It is torture, because I know that they would all reject me. There are so many beautiful girls in Santa Barbara, but not one of them ever wanted to be my girlfriend. Life would have been so perfect there if only girls were attracted to me.",2
SM," For the month of January 2013, I stayed in my room all the time, assessing my situation. I brooded and contemplated about everything. I could hear all of those happy young people partying and enjoying themselves as the new semester came to a start. I mused that I should be out there, experiencing a happy, healthy college life with a group of friends, meeting up with girls and sleeping with them, just like all other guys did in college.",1
SM,"I thought about how it was almost two years since I had moved, and that only made my rage and frustration grow. As I listened to all of those young people having so much fun right outside my window, my hatred of them all for not accepting me only festered and boiled inside me, filling me with immense pain. At one point, I looked out my window and saw couples strolling around the street, on their way to some party. They probably slept with each other that night. The sight made me feel so inferior, like a little mouse.",1
SM,"I felt like I was at the bottom of the food chain. I couldn�t fathom how I had to endure such a painful life. On that same night, I looked at the Powerball again, and saw that the jackpot had risen to over $100 million. This prompted me to drive to Arizona again, in another desperate attempt to become instantly wealthy so that I could attract beautiful girls and live the life I want.",0
SM,"After all of the rejection and mistreatment I�ve experienced at the hands of women, I knew that becoming wealthy was the only way I could become worthy of them, and so my obsession with becoming wealthy at a young age came back in full force for the first few months of 2013. By the month of April, I had driven to Arizona three more times, making a total of four trips to Arizona in my lifetime, just to buy lottery tickets out of intense desperation, believing it to be my only hope of attaining the life I desire, the life I know I�m worthy of.",1
SM,"I kept dreaming of the life I would have once I won; the beautiful blonde girlfriend, the luxurious mansion with a magnificent view, all of the exotic cars I would drive to impress girls. It gave me hope. It gave me something to live for. That hope was shattered after each attempt. None of the tickets I bought on those trips fulfilled my dreams. The reason I kept going, even after I didn�t win, was because I truly believed I was supposed to win.",2
SM,"I wanted to believe it because I wanted something to live for. I needed to have hope. I knew that if I lost all of my hope, I would have nothing to live for but revenge. Any chance of having a happy life would be doomed. At the end of March, when I checked my last set of tickets that I had bought from my last trip to Arizona, and saw that I didn�t win, any hope I had of becoming wealthy at a young age was finally and indefinitely shattered. It fully dawned on me that the life I had envisioned for myself would never come to pass.",1
SM,"The children I would have in the future with a beautiful blonde girlfriend ceased to exist, as if they were murdered. There won�t be any beautiful blonde girlfriend for me now. No girl would be my girlfriend unless I had great wealth� I learned that from my life of being rejected. I was doomed to a life of lonely virginity. In April, the Powerball lottery was introduced in the state of California, so if I ever wanted to play it again I would no longer have to drive to Arizona.",1
SM,"However, I was so shaken by not winning in the last few months that I gave up on it for a while, but eventually I would have episodes of little surges of hope in which I�d buy a few tickets, just to have something to hope for as I endure the last few months of my torturous life. All of those little surges of hope, of course, would be shattered as well.",1
SM,"During this Spring of 2013, I began to seriously think about planning the Day of Retribution. My next step towards planning for it was to buy my second handgun, a Sig Sauer P226. It is of a much higher quality than the Glock, and a lot more efficient. In turn, it was also a lot more expensive. My Glock 34 was around $700 dollars, whereas my new Sig Sauer P226 was $1100. These prices were of no concern to me, however. When I first moved and experienced all of those horrible revelations about the nature of humanity, I knew that something like the Day of Retribution could very well happen if the world continued to mistreat me.",1
SM,"I began to carefully save up all of the money that my parent�s and grandmothers were sending me. It was an ample amount to live on, leaving me with a lot left over to build up in my bank account. When I hit the $5000 dollar mark, which was fairly soon after my move, I decided never to go under it, deeming that $5000 was enough to buy all of the supplies and equipment I would need if I had to do something like this. The Day of Retribution had always been in the back of my mind as a final solution if all else failed in my life, ever since I had moved. As it so happened, all else did indeed fail.",1
SM,"Women continued to reject me and mistreat me, and I remained an unwanted virgin. For the last months of Spring, I went home a lot because the loneliness was too stifling. Going home to visit my parents was always an emotional refuge for me. During these trips home, I spent a lot of time with my little brother Jazz. My father let me drive his Mercedes SUV while I was in town, and I often took Jazz on outings with it. On these outings, I began to really bond with the boy.",1
SM,"We went to places like Barnes & Noble, the playground at the park, and local caf�s where I treated him to coffee and pastries. The parks I took him to were Serrania Park and the Woodland Hills recreation center. I like to watch him play in the playground at these parks, because those were the exact same playgrounds I played in when I was his age� When my life as actually happy. As I watched him, I dreamed about that happy life I used to live, before my whole world turned to darkness.",2
SM,"I realized how much different my brother Jazz was from me at that age. While I was shy, short, and physically weak; Jazz was tall for his age and very social. He had no problem going up to other boys at the playground and making instant friends. I began to form a bitter envy towards him, though I hid it really well. My little brother had all the potential to grow up to be a popular kid and live the life I was never able to live.",1
SM,"I cursed the world for granting my little brother Jazz so many more advantages than me. I tried not to let this ruin my relationship with him. My little brother really looked up to me. He was one of the few people who treated me with adoration, and that made me feel at least a small twinge of self-worth. It was quite surprising that he respected me so much, since I had nothing in my life to boast about to him.",1
SM,"He even asked me once if I had ever had a girlfriend, and I angrily told him that the matter was none of his concern. I didn�t want to admit to him that girl�s thought I was a loser. If he found out about that, he would respect me less. In order to boost his high opinion of me, I often sugarcoated all of my early accomplishments, such as telling him that I was an expert skateboarder and video game player.",2
SM,"People having a high opinion of me is what I�ve always wanted in life. It has always been of the utmost importance. This is why my life has been so miserable, because no one has ever had a high opinion of me. My little brother Jazz was the only one who had such an opinion, and that is why I enjoyed spending so much time with him, despite my envy of his social advantages. During one of my frequent visits home in late Spring, I reunited with my old friends Philip and Addison.",2
SM,"I had not seen them since the night I emotionally cried in front of them at the Getty museum in the beginning of 2012. This reunion was sparked by the political and philosophic conversations I had been having with Addison over Facebook. I decided to meet them at Philips house, where we would make plans for an outing around Malibu and L.A. I brought my fathers Mercedes SUV to use as our mode of transportation.",2
SM,"First, we went to Point Dume in Malibu, where Addison used to live. Going there brought back bitter memories of my previous conflict with Addison. The three of us hiked to the very tip of Point Dume, where there was a cliff that overlooked the beach. After Malibu, we decided to have dinner at the BOA Steakhouse in Santa Monica. Driving through Santa Monica was an extremely infuriating experience, just like it had always been.",2
SM,"There were so many good looking young couples walking about, enjoying the pretty night life that the attractive city had to offer. Groups of young people walked about in their little cliques. It reminded me to State Street. As I watched all of those obnoxious boys walking around with their beautiful blonde girlfriends, I wanted to run them all over with my father�s Mercedes SUV. I fantasized about how delightful that would be.",1
SM,"To literally crush their lives to a pulp, just like they had crushed mine. I tried as hard as I could to hide my envy-fueled rage from Philip and Addison. Philip was easy to fool, but Addison could tell how enraged I was. Addison knew me all too well. I spent almost all of my time in my room, brooding. I began building on all of my philosophical views and theories about the world. I had to question why things were the way they were.",1
SM,"The world is so twisted, and I wanted answers. I hated all of those obnoxious, boisterous men who were able to enjoy pleasurable sex lives with beautiful girls, but I hated the girl�s even more, because they were the ones who chose those men instead of me. It was their choice. They are the ones who deprived me of love and sex. My hatred and rage towards all women festered inside me like a plague. Their very existence is the cause of all of my torture, pain and suffering throughout my life.",1
SM,"My life turned into a living hell after I started desiring them when I hit puberty. I desire them intensely, but I could never have them. I could never have the experience of holding hands with a beautiful girl and walking on a moonlit beach, I could never embrace a girlfriend and feel her warmth and love, I could never have passionate sex with a girl and drift off to sleep with her sexy body beside me. Women deemed me unworthy of having them, and so they deprived me of an enjoyable youth, while giving their love and sex to other boys.",0
SM,"In all of those years I suffered a life of sexual starvation and unfulfilled desires. I will never get those years back. My life has been wasted, all because women hate me so much. All I had ever wanted was to love women, but their behavior has only earned my hatred. I want to have sex with them, and make them feel good, but they would be disgusted at the prospect. They have no sexual attraction towards me. It is such an injustice, and I vehemently questioned why things had to be this way.",1
SM,"Why do women behave like vicious, stupid, cruel animals who take delight in my suffering and starvation? Why do they have a perverted sexual attraction for the most brutish of men instead of gentlemen of intelligence? I concluded that women are flawed. There is something mentally wrong with the way their brains are wired, as if they haven�t evolved from animal-like thinking. They are incapable of reason or thinking rationally. They are like animals, completely controlled by their primal, depraved emotions and impulses. That is why they are attracted to barbaric, wild, beast-like men.",1
SM,"They are beasts themselves. Beasts should not be able to have any rights in a civilized society. If their wickedness is not contained, the whole of humanity will be held back from advancement to a more civilized state. Women should not have the right to choose who to mate with. That choice should be made for them by civilized men of intelligence. If women had the freedom to choose which men to mate with, like they do today, they would breed with stupid, degenerate men, which would only produce stupid, degenerate offspring.",0
SM,"This in turn would hinder the advancement of humanity. Not only hinder it, but devolve humanity completely. Women are like a plague that must be quarantined. When I came to this brilliant, perfect revelation, I felt like everything was now clear to me, in a bitter, twisted way. I am one of the few people on this world who has the intelligence to see this.",0
SM,"I am like a god, and my purpose is to exact ultimate Retribution on all of the impurities I see in the world. The Spring of 2013 was also the time when I came across the website PUAHate.com. It is a forum full of men who are starved of sex, just like me. Many of them have their own theories of what women are attracted to, and many of them share my hatred of women, though unlike me they would be too cowardly to act on it. Reading the posts on that website only confirmed many of the theories I had about how wicked and degenerate women really are.",1
SM,"Most of the people on that website have extremely stupid opinions that I found very frustrating, but I found a few to be quite insightful. The website PUAHate is very depressing. It shows just how bleak and cruel the world is due of the evilness of women. I tried to show it to my parents, to give them some sort dose of reality as to why I am so miserable. They never understood why I am so miserable. They have always had the delusion that everything is going well for me, especially my father. When I sent the link of PUAHate.com to my parents, none of them even bothered to look at the posts on there.",1
SM,"After a Spring season spent in absolute despair while other young people lived healthy lives of sexual pleasure, summer arrived. Summer is even worse than Spring, especially here. Flocks of hot, young girls go out in their shorts and bikini�s, further tantalizing my sex-starved body every time I look at them. Knowing that they gleefully show off their desirable forms, yet they would never give me a chance to be their boyfriend only increased my already boiling hatred towards all women.",1
SM,"I could not leave my apartment without seeing at least a few of them. The only place I could go where I could be at peace was the Lake Park in Goleta. I spent a lot of time there, trying to establish a sense peace and serenity whenever my loneliness in here became too unbearable. As I looked at all of the beautiful trees around me, and the towering mountains in the background, I wondered how a world so beautiful can be such a dark and cruel place.",2
SM,"Indeed, a beautiful environment is the darkest hell if you have to experience it all alone, while other men get to enjoy the company of women. I had nothing left to live for but revenge. Women must be punished for their crimes of rejecting such a magnificent gentleman as myself. All of those popular boys must be punished for enjoying heavenly lives and having sex with all the girls while I had to suffer in lonely virginity. It was already June, and I had been living here for two years. Two whole years.",1
SM,"I lived in a college town full of young, attractive students who partied and had sex all the time, and I didn�t get to experience any of it. No one invited me to any parties, and in all the times I went out by myself to this place, none of the beautiful blonde girls showed any interest in having sex with me. Not one girl. These are crimes than cannot go unpunished. The more I thought about all these injustices that were dealt to me, the more eager I became for revenge. It�s all I had left.",2
SM,"I didn�t want to die, but I knew that I had to kill myself after I exacted my revenge to avoid getting captured and imprisoned. For a while, I had been deciding on whether I would exact my Retribution in this place or at Santa Barbara City College. In both places, I had suffered greatly at the hands of everyone there. I have seen attractive young couples walking around in both places, and those were my targets.",1
SM,"I wanted to kill as many attractive young couples as I possibly could. After a lot of thinking, I came to the conclusion that the Day of Retribution will take place. On weekend nights, the streets are always flooded with young couples and good-looking popular kids walking to their parties. What better place is there to exact my Retribution on my enemies? Every time I walked around, trying to meet girls or fit in with popular kids, I�ve only been treated with disdain, as if I�m an inferior mouse. On the Day of Retribution, the tables will indeed turn, I mused to myself.",1
SM,"I will be a god, and they will all be animals that I can slaughter. They are animals� They behave like animals, and I will slaughter them like the animals they are. It came to a point where I had to set a date for the Day of Retribution. I originally considered doing it on the Halloween of 2013. That is when the entire town erupts in raucous partying. There would literally be thousands of people crowded together who I could kill with ease, and the goal was to kill everyone, to utterly destroy that wretched town. ",0
SM,"But then, after seeing footage of previous Halloween events on Youtube, I saw that there were too many cops walking around. It would be too risky. One gunshot from a cop will end everything. The Day of Retribution would have to be on a normal party weekend, so I set it for some time during November of 2013. This goal would give me five months to plan and prepare. Five more months of life, but then again I wouldn�t even call it life. The existence I�ve had on this world during the last eight years is anything but life.",1
SM,"A feeling of overwhelming dizziness and anxiety swept over me. I was actually going to die. I couldn�t believe it. Then I realized that my life was already over anyway. I was never going to lose my virginity; I was never going to experience love and sex; I was never going to have children. This final act of Retribution is the only thing I could do. It was very hard to come to terms with this fact. I felt very trapped and lost. I hated the feeling of being trapped and lost. I wanted a way out, but I saw none.",1
SM,"I had already spent two years in Santa Barbara, and I was still a virgin. Respites like these make me more aware that there are so many good and beautiful things in this world to enjoy. If my status in life were better, I would think this world to be a magnificent place, and I could truly enjoy life. If I was satisfied with my circumstances in life, I would be able to enjoy this beautiful world to its fullest. I can�t be satisfied with life if I�m a virgin and girls are repulsed by me.",1
SM,"It�s such a tragedy. I realized that I didn�t want to give up on life in this world. I wanted to live a happy life, a life in which I could have a beautiful girlfriend and experience this amazing world with her. I decided that since my plans for the Day of Retribution wouldn�t be taking place until November, I could use the time I had during the summer to give life another chance; one last chance before the end, one last ditch effort to attain happiness.",1
SM,"In late June, my mother moved out of the Summit Town Homes and bought a house in West Hills. It was the first time my mother bought a house, as she had only rented in the past. The house had recently undergone a renovation, so it was practically brand new. The house had a swimming pool and was located in a nice enough area, though I would have still preferred it if my mother had gotten married to a wealthy man and moved into a mansion. I still continued to pester her to do this, and she still stubbornly refused. I will always resent my mother for refusing to do this. If not for her sake, she should have done it for mine.",1
SM,"Joining a family of great wealth would have truly saved my life. I would have a high enough status to attract beautiful girlfriends and live above all of my enemies. All of my horrific troubles would have been eased instantly. It is very selfish of my mother to not consider this. With the help of Gavin, my parents arranged for me to have a couple of social skills counsellors to work with me. They would have a similar role that Gavin did, providing someone to take me out and help me practice socializing. They would be like hired friends.",1
SM,"Of course, I did need something like this, and I should have signed up for it when I first moved to Santa Barbara. It was a little too late at this point, I feared, but I went along with it anyway. I was so lonely, and in my loneliness I always craved having someone to talk to. The first counsellor was a very easy going man named Karlin, who was the same age as Gavin. On my first night of meeting Karlin, he took me out to this place, but nothing came out of it. We just ended up walking around until his time was up. During our walk, I asked him if he had ever had sex with girls in town, and he told me he had sex with four girls!",1
SM,"I was very jealous. Karlin was half Hawaiian and half Mexican, and he wasn�t that good looking. How on earth could he have managed to sleep with four girls in Isla Vista, while I had been there for two years and had none? It seemed absolutely preposterous. I didn�t want to see him at all after I found this out. The second counsellor that was assigned to help me was a girl named Sasha. She was only a year older than me. Sasha was the first young girl I had interacted with in the entire time I stayed in Santa Barbara, and she was only hired to talk to me. How pathetic is that?",1
SM,"At first, I didn�t want to have a female counsellor, but when I was introduced to her, I saw that she was quite a pretty looking blonde. I couldn�t refuse the opportunity to hang out with a blonde girl, despite the fact that she was a hired friend. It was the only time in my life that I had the experience of spending time with a girl my age, and even though it was all fake, I really enjoyed it. I felt so much better about life after each time we met. But then, I thought about how unfair it was that I could only get a fake little taste of such an experience, while other men get to do such a thing every single day with their girlfriends. Eventually, Sasha had to move out, and I decided not to have any more female counsellors.",2
SM,"It has the same effect as hiring a prostitute, I imagine. It temporarily feels good for the moment, but afterward it makes one feel like a pathetic loser for having to hire a girl when other men could get the experience for free. In July, I spent a lot of time exercising in my room in a final effort to appear as attractive as possible to girls. I proposed that after two weeks of rigorous exercising, I will try my hardest to go out in here and do everything I can to meet a girl and lose my virginity.",1
SM,"It had been a long time since I went out to town by myself, but I knew that I had to do it. I had nothing to lose, and my whole life was on the line. Before would set the definite decision to plan the Day of Retribution, I wanted to give women and humanity one more chance to accept me and give me a chance to have a pleasurable youth. I resolved that if I go out to the city for this final time, and I still end up going back to my room as a lonely virgin, I will have no choice but to plan my Retribution.",1
SM,"I even attended college at SBCC again. I signed up for a summer sociology class and attended it for a week, before dropping it out of the familiar frustration of girls talking to other boys instead of me. This last ditch effort of desperation to once again try to live an enjoyable college life in this place came to an ultimate and devastating culmination on Saturday night, July 20th, just a few days before my 22nd Birthday. It was the day that I decided to go out in Isla Vista in an attempt to lose my virginity before I turned 22. That was the only thing that could have saved me.",2
SM,"I was giving the female gender one last chance to provide me with the pleasures I deserved from them. I was too nervous to go out there sober, so I bought a bottle of vodka and took a few shots to garner enough courage to walk out at such an hour. I had taken one too many, for by the time I reached Del Playa Street, my head was clouded with drunkenness. The sight of that filled me with rage. I always felt as if white girls thought less of me because I was half-Asian, but then I see this white girl at the party talking to a full-blooded Asian. I never had that kind of attention from a white girl!",1
SM,"And white girls are the only girls I�m attracted to, especially the blondes. How could an ugly Asian attract the attention of a white girl, while a beautiful Eurasian like myself never had any attention from them? I thought with rage. I glared at them for a bit, and then decided I had been insulted enough. I angrily walked toward them and bumped the Asian guy aside, trying to act cocky and arrogant to both the boy and the girl. My drunken state got the better of me, and I almost fell over to the floor after a few minutes of this.",0
SM,"They said something along the lines that I was very drunk and that I needed to get some water, so I angrily left them and went out to the front yard, where the main partying happened. Rage fumed inside me as I realized that I just walked away from that confrontation, so I rushed back into the house and spitefully insulted the Asian before walking outside again. I stood awkwardly in the front yard for a bit, realizing how pathetic I looked all by myself when everyone was partying around me. To calm down, I climbed up onto a wooden ledge that bordered the street and plunged down on one of the chairs there.",0
SM,"Isla Vista was at its wildest state at that time, and I saw lots of guys walking around with hot blonde girls on their arm. It fueled me with rage, as it always had. I should be one of those guys, but no blonde girls gave me that chance. I looked down at all of them, and in my drunken carelessness, extended my arm out and pretended to shoot them all, laughing giddily as I did it. Eventually, some partiers climbed up onto the ledge. They were all obnoxious, rowdy boys whom I�ve always despised. A couple of pretty girls came up and talked to them, but not to me. They all started socializing right next to me, and none of the girls paid any attention to me.",1
SM,"I rose from my chair and tried to act arrogant and cocky toward them, throwing insults at everyone. They only laughed at me and started insulting me back. That was the last straw, I had taken enough insults that night. A dark, hate-fueled rage overcame my entire being, and I tried to push as many of them as I could from the 10-foot ledge. My main target was the girls. I wanted to punish them for talking to the obnoxious boys instead of me. It was one of the most foolish and rash things I ever did, and I almost risked everything in doing it, but I was so drunk with rage that I didn�t care.",0
SM,"I failed to push any of them from the ledge, and the boys started to push me, which resulted in me being the one to fall onto the street. When I landed, I felt a snap in my ankle, followed by a stinging pain. I slowly got up and found that I couldn�t even walk. I had to stumble, and stumble I did. I tried to get away from there as fast as I could. As I stumbled a few yards down Del Playa with my shattered leg, I realized that someone had stolen my Gucci sunglasses that my mother had given me. I loved those sunglasses, and had to get them back.",0
SM,"I vehemently turned around and staggered back towards the party. At that point, I was so drunk that I forgot where the party was, and ended up walking onto the front yard of the house next to it, demanding to know who took my sunglasses. The people in this house must have been friends with the ones I previously fought with, for they greeted me with vicious hostility. They called me names like faggot and pussy, typical things those types of scumbags would say. A whole group of the obnoxious brutes came up and dragged me onto their driveway, pushing and hitting me.",1
SM,"I wanted to fight and kill them all. I managed to throw one punch toward the main attacker, but that only caused them to beat me even more. I fell to the ground where they started kicking me and punching me in the face. Eventually, some other people from the street broke up the fight. I managed to have the strength to stand up and stagger away. It was the first time in my life that I had been truly beaten up physically to the point where my face was bruised up. I had suffered a lot of bullying in my life, but most of it wasn�t physical.",2
SM,"I had never been beaten and humiliated that badly. Everyone in this city saw what happened, and it was truly horrific. The worst part of this whole ordeal was not getting beaten up, oh no. It was the fact that no one showed any concern. When I woke up the next morning, my leg was in absolute agony. It was purple and swollen, and I could not even stumble anymore. I had to crawl. Being fully sober, all of my anxiety came back. It became very clear to me what had happened.",1
SM,"I felt enraged by everything, but also fearful that I might get in trouble. I did try to push girls off of a ledge and threatened to kill all of those people, which could implicate me. I had to concoct a fairly altered story to explain to the police, who would inevitably have to interview me once I got to the hospital and reported my injury.",2
SM,"My 22nd Birthday was a miserable experience. I sat around at my mother�s house, staring at my broken leg, feeling so pathetic for being a cripple, as well as a 22-year-old virgin.  Only now, I was ready and capable of fighting back against the cruelty of women. Back when I was a weak and timid boy at Taft High School, I was powerless and frightened, having to resort to hiding in a life of playing video games. All of the suffering, loneliness, rejection, and humiliation I had to experience since then had strengthened me.",1
SM,"The hatred that festered inside me in all of those years leading up to this point had empowered me in a dark, twisted way. I was now armed with weapons, possessed great intelligence and philosophical insight, with the willpower to exact the most catastrophic act of vengeance the world will ever see. It fully dawned on me that I would now have to bring about the Day of Retribution. There was no other hope. I mused that once I descend upon this city, armed with my weapons and my burning hatred, I would definitely make sure to target the people who lived in that house I was attacked in.",2
SM,"The plan was to destroy the entirety of Isla Vista, and kill every single person in it, or at least kill as many popular young people I could before the police arrive and I�d have to kill myself. I felt so shocked and overwhelmed upon realizing that it was definitely going to resort to this. I was going to die soon, and that in itself was hard to accept. I didn�t want to die, but I would have no choice. Vengeance is the only path; all other paths had been closed shut.",1
SM,"I thought it to be such a tragedy that I was actually going to wage war against women and all of humanity. But then again, women�s rejection of me was a declaration of war. They insulted me by deeming me inferior of their love and sex. They hate me, and I will return that hatred one-thousand fold. I will inflict suffering on everyone in Isla Vista, just like they have made me suffer. In the past, I have always been at their mercy, and I was given none. On the Day of Retribution, everyone will be at my mercy, and in turn I will show them no mercy at all.",2
SM,My Retribution will be so devastating that it will shake the very foundations of the world. There was no way I�d be well enough to prepare for the Day of Retribution by November. There was too little time. I made a new plan to set the ultimate and final date for the Day of Retribution to be at the end of the Spring of 2014. This would give me plenty of time to prepare. The Day of Retribution was now my whole reason for living. It�s all I have to live for.,1
SM,"This act of deadly vengeance against the people who have wronged me is my sole purpose on this world. I needed as much time as possible in order to plan it efficiently. Postponing the Day of Retribution also gave me a few more months of life. Perhaps I would also use that time to look for a way out. I have always been itching for a way out of this, and even with the recent events that had occurred, a small part of me still clung to that inkling of hope. Gavin came to visit me at the hotel, and he was welcome company. It was really getting lonely there, though it was definitely better than being lonely here.",1
SM,"The two of us sat down for three hours in my hotel room to have an important conversation. I explained to him my finely altered version of everything that happened on that night here. He didn�t seem surprised. When he was my age, he was wrong with this world. Maddy was my first friend in America. As a child, I played with her as an equal. Now she was my enemy. I would take great delight in torturing and flaying her and every single one of her spoiled, obnoxious evil friends. When she and her mother came to eat dinner with us, I had to keep calm as I hobbled out of my room on my crutches to greet them. That relaxing month at mother�s was like the comfort before the storm.",1
SM,"Once I go back, fully recovered, the final dark chapter of my life will commence. I dreaded what will come of it. After I have killed all of the sorority girls at the Alpha Phi House, I will quickly get into the the SUV before the police arrive, assuming they would arrive within 3 minutes. I will then make my way to Del Playa, splattering as many of my enemies as I can with the SUV, and shooting anyone I don�t splatter.",1
SM,"I can only imagine how sweet it will be to ram the SUV into all of those groups of popular young people who I�ve always witnessed walking right in the middle of the road as if they are better than everyone else. When they are writhing in pain, their bodies broken and dying after I splatter them, they will fully realize their crimes. Once I reach Del Playa Street, I will dump the bag of severed heads I had saved from my previous victims, proclaiming to everyone how much I�ve made them all suffer. Once they see all of their friend�s heads roll onto the street, everyone will fear me as the powerful god I am.",1
SM,"I will then start massacring everyone on Del Playa Street. I will pull up next to a house party and fire bullets at everyone partying on the front yard. I will specifically target the good looking people, and all of the couples. After I have destroyed a house party, I will continue down Del Playa, destroying everything and everyone. When I see the first police car come to their rescue, I will drive away as fast as I can, shooting and ramming anyone in my path until I find a suitable place to finally end my life.",1
SM,"To end my life, I will quickly swallow all of the Xanax and Vicodin pills I have left, along with an ample amount of hard liquor. Immediately after imbibing this mixture, I will shoot myself in the head with two of my handguns simultaneously. If the gunshots don�t kill me, the deadly drug mixture eventually will. I will not suffer being captured and sent to prison. I must plan this very efficiently. Nothing can go wrong. It needs to be perfect. This is now my sole purpose on this world. My plans will come to fruition, and I mustn�t let anyone stop me.",2
SM,"On the week leading up to date I set for the Day of Retribution, I uploaded several videos onto Youtube in order to express my views and feelings to the world, though I don�t plan on uploading my ultimate video until minutes before the attack, because on that video I will talk about exactly why I�m doing this. I titled one of the videos I uploaded �Why do girls hate me so much?� in which I ask the entire population of women the question I�ve wanted to ask them for so many years. Why do they hate me so much? Why have they never fancied me? Why do they give their love and sex to other men, but not me, even though I deserve them more?",2
SM,"In the video, I show that I am the perfect, magnificent gentleman, worthy of having a beautiful girlfriend, making the world see how unreasonable it is that I�ve had to struggle all my life to get a girlfriend. I kept one of my handguns with a few loaded magazines near me just in case such a thing did happen. If they did show up, I would have to try to quickly shoot them all and escape out the back window. I would then have to perform a hasty mockery of my plans, with the police on my tail. That will ruin everything. Thankfully, all suspicion of me was dropped after I took down the videos from Youtube, and the police never came back.",2
SM,"During the last few weeks of my life, I continued my daily adventures around town, trying to experience as much of the world as I could before I die. Upon doing this, I realized that the only world I can possibly ever experience is a twisted world of constant suffering. No matter where I go, I have to face all of the same injustices. Young couples are everywhere! They constantly remind me of what I have lacked all my life. I cannot go out of my room without seeing a young couple that would make me feel envious and enraged.",1
SM,"How dare those girls give their love and sex to those other men and not me, I constantly think when I see young couples. There is nowhere in the world I can go anymore. There is no more life to live. The Day of Retribution is all I have. It is the final solution to all of the injustices of this twisted world. By doing this, I will set right all of the wrongs I�ve had to face in my sorry excuse of a life. Every single time I�ve seen a guy walk around with his beautiful girlfriend, I�ve always wanted to kill them both in the most painful way possible. They deserve it. They must be punished.",1
SM,"The males deserve to be punished for living a better and more pleasurable life than me, and the females deserve to be punished for giving that pleasurable life to those males instead of me. On the Day of Retribution, I will finally be able to punish them ALL. When I think about the amazing and blissful life I could have lived if only females were sexually attracted to me, my entire being burns with hatred. They denied me a happy life, and in return I will take away all of their lives. It is only fair. I am not part of the human race. Humanity has rejected me. The females of the human species have never wanted to mate with me, so how could I possibly consider myself part of humanity?",1
SM,"Humanity has never accepted me among them, and now I know why. I am more than human. I am superior to them all. I am Elliot Rodger� Magnificent, glorious, supreme, eminent� Divine! I am the closest thing there is to a living god. Humanity is a disgusting, depraved, and evil species. It is my purpose to punish them all. I will purify the world of everything that is wrong with it. On the Day of Retribution, I will truly be a powerful god, punishing everyone I deem to be impure and depraved. And that is how my tragic life ends.",1
SM,"Who would have thought my life will turn out this way? I didn�t. There was a time when I thought this world was a good and happy place. As a child, my whole world was innocent. It wasn�t until I went through puberty and started desiring girls that my whole life turned into a living hell. I desired girls, but girls never desired me back. There is something very wrong with that. It is an injustice that cannot go unpunished. There is no way I could live a happy life with such a scenario.",1
SM,"Not only did I have to waste my entire youth suffering in loneliness and unfulfilled desire, but I had to live with the knowledge that other boys my age were able to have all of the experiences I craved for. It is absolutely unfair and unjust. In addition, I had to suffer the shame of other boys respecting me less because I didn�t get any girls. Everyone knew I was a virgin. Everyone knew how undesirable I was to girls, and I hated everyone just for knowing it. I want people to think that girls adore me. I want to feel worthy.",1
SM,"There is no pride in living as a lonely, unwanted outcast. I wouldn�t even call it living. I am not meant to live such a pathetic, miserable life. That is not my place in this world. I will not bow down and accept such a horrific fate. If humanity will not give me a worthy place among them, then I will destroy them all. I am better than all of them. I am a god. Exacting my Retribution is my way of proving my true worth to the world. In the midst of my suffering, I have been able to see the world much clearer than others. I have vision that other people lack. Through my suffering, I have been able to see just how twisted and wrong this world really is.",1
SM,"The current state of humanity is what makes it wrong. I look at the human race and I see only vileness and depravity, all because of an act known as� sexuality�Sex is by far the most evil concept in existence. The fact that life itself exists through sex just proves that life is flawed. The act of sex gives human beings a tremendous amount of pleasure. Pleasure they don�t deserve. No one deserves to experience so much pleasure, especially since some humans get to experience it while some are denied it. When a man has sex with a beautiful woman, he probably feels like he is in heaven. But the world is not supposed to be heaven.",2
SM,"For some humans to actually be able to feel such heights of heavenly pleasure is selfish and hedonistic. The ultimate evil behind sexuality is the human female. They are the main instigators of sex. They control which men get it and which men don�t. Women are flawed creatures, and my mistreatment at their hands has made me realize this sad truth. There is something very twisted and wrong with the way their brains are wired. They think like beasts, and in truth, they are beasts. Women are incapable of having morals or thinking rationally. They are completely controlled by their depraved emotions and vile sexual impulses.",1
SM,"Because of this, the men who do get to experience the pleasures of sex and the privilege of breeding are the men who women are sexually attracted to� the stupid, degenerate, obnoxious men. I have observed this all my life. The most beautiful of women choose to mate with the most brutal of men, instead of magnificent gentlemen like myself. Women should not have the right to choose who to mate and breed with. That decision should be made for them by rational men of intelligence.",1
SM,"If women continue to have rights, they will only hinder the advancement of the human race by breeding with degenerate men and creating stupid, degenerate offspring. This will cause humanity to become even more depraved with each generation. Women have more power in human society than they deserve, all because of sex. There is no creature more evil and depraved than the human female. Women are like a plague. They don�t deserve to have any rights. Their wickedness must be contained in order prevent future generations from falling to degeneracy. Women are vicious, evil, barbaric animals, and they need to be treated as such.",1
SM,"In fully realizing these truths about the world, I have created the ultimate and perfect ideology of how a fair and pure world would work. In an ideal world, sexuality would not exist. It must be outlawed. In a world without sex, humanity will be pure and civilized. Men will grow up healthily, without having to worry about such a barbaric act. All men will grow up fair and equal, because no man will be able to experience the pleasures of sex while others are denied it. The human race will evolve to an entirely new level of civilization, completely devoid of all the impurity and degeneracy that exists today.",1
SM,"In order to completely abolish sex, women themselves would have to be abolished. All women must be quarantined like the plague they are, so that they can be used in a manner that actually benefits a civilized society. In order carry this out, there must exist a new and powerful type of government, under the control of one divine ruler, such as myself. The ruler that establishes this new order would have complete control over every aspect of society, in order to direct it towards a good and pure place. At the disposal of this government, there needs to be a highly trained army of fanatically loyal troops, in order to enforce such revolutionary laws.",1
SM,"The first strike against women will be to quarantine all of them in concentration camps. At these camps, the vast majority of the female population will be deliberately starved to death. That would be an efficient and fitting way to kill them all off. I would take great pleasure and satisfaction in condemning every single woman on earth to starve to death. I would have an enormous tower built just for myself, where I can oversee the entire concentration camp and gleefully watch them all die. If I can�t have them, no one will, I�d imagine thinking to myself as I oversee this.",1
SM,"Women represent everything that is unfair with this world, and in order to make the world a fair place, they must all be eradicated. A few women would be spared, however, for the sake of reproduction. These women would be kept and bred in secret labs. There, they will be artificially inseminated with sperm samples in order to produce offspring. Their depraved nature will slowly be bred out of them in time. Future generations of men would be oblivious to these remaining women�s existence, and that is for the best. If a man grows up without knowing of the existence of women, there will be no desire for sex. Sexuality will completely cease to exist. Love will cease to exist. There will no longer be any imprint of such concepts in the human psyche.",1
SM,"It is the only way to purify the world. In such a pure world, the man�s mind can develop to greater heights than ever before. Future generations will live their lives free of having to worry about the barbarity of sex and women, which will enable them to expand their intelligence and advance the human race to a state of perfect civilization. It is such a shameful pity that my ideal world cannot be created. I realized long ago that there is no way I could possibly rise to such a level of power in my lifetime, with the way the world is now.",1
SM,"Such a thing will never become a reality for me, but it did give me something to fantasize about as I burned with hatred towards all women for rejecting me throughout the years. This whole viewpoint and ideology of abolishing sex stems from being deprived of it all my life. If I cannot have it, I will do everything I can to DESTROY IT. My orchestration of the Day of Retribution is my attempt to do everything, in my power, to destroy everything I cannot have.",1
SM,"All of those beautiful girls I�ve desired so much in my life, but can never have because they despise and loathe me, I will destroy. All of those popular people who live hedonistic lives of pleasure, I will destroy, because they never accepted me as one of them. I will kill them all and make them suffer, just as they have made me suffer. It is only fair. Why do things have to be this way? I�m sure that is the question everyone will be asking after the Day of Retribution is over. They will all be asking why. Indeed, why? That is the question I�ve had for everyone throughout all my years of suffering.",1
SM,"Why was I condemned to live a life of misery and worthlessness while other men were able to experience the pleasures of sex and love with women? Why do things have to be this way? I ask all of you. All I ever wanted was to love women, and in turn to be loved by them back. Their behavior towards me has only earned my hatred, and rightfully so! I am the true victim in all of this. I am the good guy. Humanity struck at me first by condemning me to experience so much suffering. I didn�t ask for this. I didn�t want this. I didn�t start this war� I wasn�t the one who struck first� But I will finish it by striking back. I will punish everyone. And it will be beautiful. Finally, at long last, I can show the world my true worth.",1
SM,"There is only one victory, but many defeats. To lose our lands, our culture and our people is a defeat. To continue on without our culture, but still own our lands, is a defeat.  To survive with our culture, but to lose our lands, to lose our future, is a defeat. There is only one victory. The survival of our people, our culture and our lands isn�t enough. We must thrive, we must march ever forward to our place among the stars and we WILL reach the destiny our people deserve. Anything else is a defeat.",1
SM,"The war will not be easy, the death toll will assuredly be high. The going will be tough and many of us will die. I cannot guarantee it will be comfortable, I cannot guarantee it will be easy and I cannot guarantee that every act will be a success. All I can guarantee is that inaction is sure defeat, power structures will be tested and likely will fall and most of all there is only the future ahead and attempting to march back to any earlier time will get you no where at all. You may stumble. You may fall. But the only way to get to the final destination, total victory, is to get up and keep marching forward. No matter what. March.",2
SM,"Mistakes will be made, losses will be had, some failures are certain and some endeavours will go bad. But in the end the struggle is a beauty in itself, and the victory will be all the sweeter because of it.Final victory is yours, if you have the will for it. As for me, my time has come. I cannot guarantee my success. All I know is the certainty of my will and the necessity of my cause. Live or die, know I did it all for you; my friends, my family, my people, my culture, my RACE. Goodbye, god bless you all and I will see you in Valhalla. EUROPA RISES.",1
SM,"It�s the birthrates. It�s the birthrates. It�s the birthrates. If there is one thing I want you to remember from these writings, its that the birthrates must change. Even if we were to deport all Non-Europeans from our lands tomorrow, the European people would still be spiraling into decay and eventual death. Every day we become fewer in number, we grow older,we grow weaker. In the end we must return to replacement fertility levels, or it will kill us. To maintain a population the people must achieve a birthrate that reaches replacement fertility levels.",1
SM,"In the Western world this is roughly 2.06 births per woman. There is not a single Western country, not a single white nation, that reaches these levels. Not in Europe, not in the Americas, not in Australia or New Zealand. White people are failing to reproduce, failing to create families, failing to have children. But despite this sub-replacement fertility rate, the population in the West is increasing, and rapidly. How is this possible? Mass immigration and the higher fertility rates of the immigrants themselves are causing this increase in population.",0
SM,"We are experiencing an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders, legally.Invited by the state and corporate entities to replace the White people who have failed to reproduce, failed to create the cheap labour, new consumers and tax base that the corporations and states need to thrive. This crisis of mass immigration and sub-replacement fertility is an assault on the European people that, if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and cultural replacement of the European people.",2
SM,"To see this in full effect, you only have to look at the population statistics in Western nations for the year 2100. In 2100,despite the ongoing effect of sub-replacement fertility,the population figures show that the population does not decrease inline with the sub-replacement fertility levels, but actually maintains and, even in many White nations, rapidly increases. All through immigration. This is ethnic replacement. This is cultural replacement. This is racial replacement. This is WHITE GENOCIDE.",2
SM,"To return to replacement fertility levels is priority number one. But it is no simple task.There are myriad reasons behind the decline in fertility rates and the destruction of the traditional family unit. We must inevitably correct the disaster of hedonistic,nihilistic individualism. But it will take take some time, time we do not have due to the crisis of mass immigration. Due to mass immigration we lack the time scale required to enact the civilizational paradigm shift we need to undertake to return to health and prosperity. Mass immigration will disenfranchise us,subvert our nations, destroy our communities, destroy our ethnic binds, destroy our cultures, destroy our peoples.",1
SM,"Long before low fertility levels ever could. Thus, before we deal with the fertility rates, we must deal with both the invaders within our lands and the invaders that seek to enter our lands. We must crush immigration and deport those invaders already living on our soil. It is not just a matter of our prosperity, but the very survival of our people. I had a regular childhood, without any great issues. I had little interest in education during my schooling, barely achieving a passing grade. I did not attend University as I had no great interest in anything offered in the Universities to study.",0
SM,"I worked for a short time before making some money investing in Bitconnect, then used the money from the investment to travel. More recently I have been working part time as a kebab removalist. I am just a regular White man, from a regular family. Who decided to take a stand to ensure a future for my people. To most of all show the invaders that our lands will never be their lands, our homelands are our own and that, as long as a white man still lives, they will NEVER conquer our lands and they will never replace our people.",1
SM,"To take revenge on the invaders for the hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by foreign invaders in European lands throughout history. To take revenge for the enslavement of millions of Europeans taken from their lands by the Islamic slavers. To take revenge for the thousands of European lives lost to terror attacks throughout European lands. To take revenge for Ebba Akerlund. To directly reduce immigration rates to European lands by intimidating and physically removing the invaders themselves. To agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to cause them to overextend their own hand and experience the eventual and inevitable backlash as a result.",2
SM,"To incite violence, retaliation and further divide between the European people and the invaders currently occupying European soil. To avenge those European men and women lost in the constant and never ending wars of European history who died for their lands, died for their people only to have their lands given away to any foreign scum that bother to show up. To agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to over extend their own hand and experience the eventual backlash. To show the effect of direct action, lighting a path forward for those that wish to follow.",1
SM,"A path for those that wish to free their ancestors lands from the invaders grasp and to be a beacon for those that wish to create a lasting culture, to tell them they are not alone. To create an atmosphere of fear and change in which drastic,powerful and revolutionary action can occur. To add momentum to the pendulum swings of history, further destabilizing and polarizing Western society in order to eventually destroy the current nihilistic, hedonistic, individualistic insanity that has taken control of Western thought. ",1
SM,"To drive a wedge between the nations of NATO that are European and the Turks that also make a part of the NATO forces, thereby turning NATO once more into a united European army and pushing the Turkey once more back to the true position of a foreign, enemy force. Finally, to create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural, political and racial divide within the United states.",1
SM,"This conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US along political, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines. This balkanization of the US will not only result in the racial separation of the people within the United States ensuring the future of the White race on the North American continent, but also ensuring the death of the �melting pot� pipe dream. Furthermore this balkanization will also reduce the USA�s ability to project power globally, and thereby ensure that never again can such a situation as the US involvement in Kosovo ever occur again where US NATO forces fought beside muslims and slaughtered Christian Europeans attempting to remove these Islamic occupiers from Europe.",2
SM,"We must ensure the existence of our people, and a future for white children. There was a period of time 2 years prior to the attack to the attack that dramatically changed my views.The period of time was from, beginning of April,2017 until the end May, 2017. In this time period a series of events broke down my own reserves, my reservations, my cynicism and revealed the truth of the Wests current situation. These events turned my thoughts from pursuing a democratic, political solution and finally caused the revelation of the truth, that a violent, revolutionary solution is the only possible solution to our current crisis.",0
SM,"I was travelling as a tourist in Western Europe at the time, France, Spain Portugal and others.The first event that begun the change was the terror attack in Stockholm, on the 7th of April 2017. It was another terror attack in the seemingly never ending attacks that had been occurring on a regular basis throughout my adult life. But for some reason this was different. The jaded cynicism with which I had greeted previous attacks didn�t eventuate. Something that had been a part of my life for as long as I could remember, cynicism in the face of attacks on the West by islamic invaders, was suddenly no longer there.",1
SM,"I could no longer bring the sneer to my face, I could no longer turn my back on the violence. Something, this time, was different. That difference was Ebba Akerlund. Young, innocent and dead Ebba. Ebba was walking to meet her mother after school, when she was murdered by an Islamic attacker, driving a stolen vehicle through the shopping promenade on which she was walking. Ebba was partially deaf, unable to hear the attacker coming. Ebba death at the hands of the invaders, the indignity of her violent demise and my inability to stop it broke through my own jaded cynicism like a sledgehammer. I could no longer ignore the attacks. They were attacks on my people, attacks on my culture, attacks on my faith and attacks on my soul. They would not be ignored.",1
SM,"The second event was the 2017 French General election. The candidates were an obvious sign of our times: a globalist, capitalist, egalitarian, an ex-investment banker with no national beliefs other than the pursuit of profit versus a milquetoast,feckless, civic nationalist, an uncontroversial figure who�s most brave and inspired idea resolved to the possible deportation of illegal immigrants. Despite this ridiculous match up, the possibility of a victory by the quasi-nationalist was at least, to myself, a sign that maybe a political solution was still possible. The internationalist, globalist, anti-white, ex-banker won.",0
SM,"It wasn�t even close. The truth of the political situation in Europe was suddenly impossible to accept.My despair set in.My belief in a democratic solution vanished. The final push was witnessing the state of French cities and towns. For many years I had been hearing and reading of the invasion of France by non-whites, many of these rumours and stories I believed to be exaggerations, created to push a political narrative. But once I arrived in France, I found the stories to not only be true, but profoundly understated. In every french city, in every french town the invaders were there.",2
SM,"No matter where I travelled, no matter how small or rural the community I visited, the invaders were there. The french people were often in a minority themselves, and the french that were in the streets were often alone, childless or of advanced age. Whilst the immigrants were young, energized and with large families and many children. I remember pulling into a shopping centre car park to buy groceries in some moderate sized town in Eastern France, of roughly 15-25 thousand people. As I sat there in the parking lot, in my rental car, I watched a stream of the invaders walk through the shopping centre�s front doors.",2
SM,"For every french man or woman there was double the number of invaders. I had seen enough, and in anger, drove out of the the town, refusing to stay any longer in the cursed place and headed on to the next town. Driving toward the next french town on my itinerary, knowing that inevitably the invaders would also been there, I found my emotions swinging between fuming rage and suffocating despair at the indignity of the invasion of France, the pessimism of the french people, the loss of culture and identity and the farce of the political solutions offered.",2
SM,"I came upon a cemetery, one of the many mass cemeteries created to bury the French and other European soldiers lost in the Wars that crippled Europe. I had seen many pictures and heard many people discuss the cemeteries, but even knowing about these cemeteries in advance, I was still not prepared for the sight. Simple, white, wooden crosses stretching from the fields beside the roadway, seemingly without end, into the horizon. Their number uncountable, the representation of their loss unfathomable. I pulled my rental car over, and sat, staring at these crosses and contemplating how it was that despite these men and womens sacrifice, despite their bravery, we had still fallen so far.I broke into tears, sobbing alone in the car, staring at the crosses, at the forgotten dead.",2
SM,"Why were we allowing these soldiers deaths to be in vain? Why were we allowing the invaders to conquer us? Overcome us? Without a single shot fired in response? I could have chosen any weapons or means.A TATP filled rental van. Household flour, a method of dispersion and an ignition source.A ballpeen hammer and a wooden shield. Gas, fire, vehicular attacks, plane attacks, any means were available. I had the will and I had the resources. I chose firearms for the affect it would have on social discourse, the extra media coverage they would provide and the affect it could have on the politics of United states and thereby the political situation of the world. The US is torn into many factions by its second amendment, along state, social, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines.",0
SM,"With enough pressure the left wing within the United states will seek to abolish the second amendment, and the right wing within the US will see this as an attack on their very freedom and liberty. This attempted abolishment of rights by the left will result in a dramatic polarization of the people in the United States and eventually a fracturing of the US along cultural and racial lines. New Zealand was not the original choice for attack, I only arrived to New Zealand to live temporarily whilst I planned and trained, but I soon found out that New Zealand was as target rich of an environment as anywhere else in the West.",1
SM,"Secondly an attack in New Zealand would bring to attention the truth of the assault on our civilization, that no where in the world was safe, the invaders were in all of our lands, even in the remotest areas of the world and that there was no where left to go that was safe and free from mass immigration. But after visiting the mosques in Christchurch and Linwood and seeing the desecration of the church that had been converted to a mosque in Ashburton, my plans changed. The Christchurch and Linwood mosques had far more invaders, in a more prominent and optically foreign building, with less students, more adults and a prior history of extremism.",1
SM,"Attacking these mosques also allowed for an extra planned attack on the mosque in Ashburton, whilst I am unsure as of this time of writing whether I will reach that target, it was a bonus objective. A muslim man or woman choosing to invade our lands live on our soil and replace our people? Yes, I dislike them. The only muslim I truly hate is the convert, those from our own people that turn their backs on their heritage, turn their backs on their cultures, turn their back on their traditions and became blood traitors to their own race. These I hate. I spent many years travelling through many, many nations.",1
SM,"Everywhere I travelled, barring a few small exceptions, I was treated wonderfully, often as a guest and even as a friend. The varied cultures of the world greeted me with warmth and compassion, and I very much enjoyed nearly every moment I spent with them. I wish the different peoples of their world all the best regardless of their ethnicity, race, culture of faith and that they live in peace and prosperity, amongst their own people, practicing their own traditions, in their own nations. But, if those same people seek to come to my peoples lands, replace my people, subjugate my people, make war upon on my people.",2
SM,"Fertility rates are cultural, there is no denying that, so there was a war of cultures being fought by the invaders, and my attack was a response to this. Though I hold no great fear or distrust of other peoples. Islamic nations in particular have high birth rates, regardless of race or ethnicity, and in this there was an anti-islamic motivation to the attacks, as well as a want for revenge against islam for the 1300 years of war and devastation that it has brought upon the people of the West and other peoples of the world. To ensure diverse peoples remain diverse, separate, unique,undiluted in unrestrained in cultural or ethnic expression and autonomy.",1
SM,"To ensure that the peoples of the world remain true to their traditions and faiths and do not become watered down and corrupted by the influence of outsiders. The attack was to ensure a preservation of beauty, art and tradition. In my mind a rainbow is only beautiful to due its variety of colours, mix the colours together and you destroy them all and they are gone forever and the end result is far from anything beautiful. The police force in New Zealand is on overall good terms with the public and, unlike in other European nations such as France, the UK, or Norway they have so far remained loyal to the people.",1
SM,"So harming the NZ police officers was to be avoided at all costs unless the state enforcer was from an invaders background. Striking quickly and then exfiltrating from the area of attack was the plan, to avoid the responders of the state and to avoid a situation where I was forced to harm them. In the event of an engagement I had the somewhat quixotic notion of shouting down responding state enforcers, intimidating them into dropping their weapons and if that failed, only targeting non-vital areas of their body such as the anterior of the thigh, shoulder or a side-on through shot of the calf, hamstring or gluteal muscles so as to cause the least amount of harm as possible and to allow for a quick recovery. How this worked in reality, well�only you know.",2
SM,"I believe racial differences exist between peoples and they have a great impact on the way we shape our societies I also believe fertility rates are part of those racial differences and that the immigrants in our lands with high fertility must be forced out to ensure the existance of our race. So yes. I am a racist. I am not afraid of islam, only that, due to its high fertility rates, it will grow to replace other peoples and faiths. Conservatism is corporatism in disguise, I want no part of it.",2
SM," For once, the person that will be called a fascist, is an actual fascist. I am sure the journalists will love that. I mostly agree with Sir Oswald Mosley�s views and consider myself an Eco-fascist by nature. The nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People�s Republic of China. The last virtues of a dying nation are tolerance and apathy, and I want none of it. I was a communist, then an anarchist and finally a libertarian before coming to be an eco-fascist.",2
SM,"Australia, just like the rest of the colonies of Europe, is simply an off-shoot of the European people. A finger on the hand of the body of Europe. The origins of my language is European, my culture is European, my political beliefs are European, my philosophical beliefs are European, my identity is European and, most importantly, my blood is European. To ensure the existence of our people and a future for white children, whilst preserving and exulting nature and the natural order. The gun owners of New Zealand are a beaten, miserable bunch of baby boomers, who have long since given up the fight.When was the last time they won increased rights? Their loss was inevitable.I just accelerated things a bit.",1
SM,"They had long since lost their cities, take a look at Auckland. Did you really expect they would not also lose their rights? Democracy is mob rule and the mob itself is ruled by our enemies. The global and corporate run press controls them, the education system long since fallen to the long march through the institutions carried out by the marxists controls them, the state long since heavily lost to its corporate backers controls them and the anti-white media machine controls them. Do not suffer under the delusion of an effortless, riskless democratic victory.",2
SM,"Prepare for war, prepare for violence and prepare for risk, loss, struggle, death. Force is the only path to power and the only path to true victory. There is no nation in the world that wasn�t founded by, or maintained by, the use of force. Force is power. History is the history of power. Violence is power and violence is the reality of history. Wake up. Victory is all that matters. Children of invaders do not stay children, they become adults and reproduce, creating more invaders to replace your people.They grow up and vote against your peoples own wishes, for the interests of their own people and identity. They grow up and take the potential homes of your own people for themselves, they occupy positions of power, remove wealth and destroy social trust.",2
SM,"Any invader you kill, of any age, is one less enemy your children will have to face. Would you rather do the killing, or leave it to your children? Your grand children? Ask yourself, truly, what has modern conservatism managed to conserve? What does it seek to conserve? The natural environment?Western Culture? Ethnic autonomy? Religion? The nation? The race? Nothing is conserved. The natural environment is industrialized, pulverized and commoditized.",1
SM,"Western culture is trivialized, pulped and blended into a smear of meaningless nothing, with the only tenets and beliefs seemingly held to are the myth of the individual, the value of work productivity for the benefit of your capitalist owners and the sovereignty of private property to ensure none of us get grand ideas of taking the unearned wealth of our owners. Ethnic autonomy? Destroyed in the name of cheap labour, whilst they may publicly object to the illegal immigration of the third world masses, privately they push for as much migration as possible, anything to decrease the labour cost of production and line their pockets with the profits. They removed the Europeans peoples autonomy and sovereignty for their own lust for power and wealth.",2
SM,"Religion? What remains? Empty churches and full shopping centers? Drive through confessionals and no fault divorce? Any religious ideal that stood between the wealthy and wealth generation was downplayed, sidelined and quietly dismantled. All so that they could line their pockets without complaints or objections The nation? What nations do we have to conserve? What our own nations now based on? Their is no shared culture, ethnicity, language, values or beliefs. Anyone can be a member of our nation, as long as they have the paperwork. They need not be born here, share our race, our language, our culture or our beliefs.",1
SM,"Hear the conservatives cry, as long as they are willing to WORK, let them in! Let them earn our wealthy benefactors their second yachts and their fifth properties! The Race? They don�t even BELIEVE in the race, they don�t even have the gall to say race exists. And above all they don�t even care if it does. It�s profit, and profit alone that drives them, all else is secondary. The notion of a racial future or destiny is as foreign to them as social responsibilities. Not a thing has been conserved other than corporate profits and the the ever increasing wealth of the 1% that exploit the people for their own benefit.",2
SM,"Conservatism is dead. Thank god. Now let us bury it and move on to something of worth.  I do not want to convert you, I do not want to come to an understanding.  Egalitarians and those that believe in heirachy will never come to terms. I don�t want you by my side or I don�t want share power. I want you in my sights. I want your neck under my boot. SEE YOU ON THE STREETS YOU ANTI-WHITE SCUM. You can live in peace in your own lands, and may no harm come to you. On the east side of the Bosphorus. But if you attempt to live in European lands, anywhere west of the Bosphorus.",1
SM,"We will kill you and drive you roaches from our lands. We are coming for Constantinople and we will destroy every mosque and minaret in the city. The Hagia Sophia will be free of minarets and Constantinople will be rightfully christian owned once more. FLEE TO YOUR OWN LANDS, WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE CHANCE. The people who are to blame most are ourselves, european men. Strong men do not get ethnically replaced, strong men do not allow their culture to degrade, strong men do not allow their people to die. Weak men have created this situation and strong men are needed to fix it.",1
SM,"The true number of these events perpetrated across the Western world is unknown and certainly under reported, as both the state, the media and the judicial system work in unison to hide these atrocities, in the fear that knowledge of these events would enrage the native people of the West and damage the perception of our new �Multicultural utopia�. Finally I would like to send a message to the perpetrators of these attacks, and their families. You will hang. If you are released we will find you and kill you, if you are in prison we will reach you there, if you try to hide these rapist scum we will kill you as well.",1
SM,"For the disgrace you have heaped upon the European people and the distress you have caused to European women, you will die. KILL THE RAPISTS, HANG THEIR FAMILIES. Why is diversity said to be our greatest strength? Does anyone even ask why? It is spoken like a mantra and repeated ad infinitum �diversity is our greatest strength, diversity is our greatest strength, diversity is our greatest strength��. Said throughout the media, spoken by politicians, educators and celebrities. But no one ever seems to give a reason why.",1
SM,"What gives a nation strength? And how does diversity increase that strength? What part of diversity causes this increase in strength? No one can give an answer. Meanwhile the diverse nations across the world are scenes of endless social, political, religious and ethnic conflict. The United states is one of the most diverse nations on Earth, and they are about an inch away from tearing each other to pieces. Brazil with all its racial diversity is completely fractured as a nation, where people cannot get along and separate and self segregate whenever possible.",2
SM,"South Africa with all its �diversity� is turning into a bloody backwater as its diversity increases, black on other black, black on white, white on black, black on Indian, doesn�t not matter, its ethnicity vs ethnicity. They all turn on each other in the end. Why is it that what gives Western nations strength diversity is not what gives Eastern nations China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea their strength? How are they so strong, China set to be the worlds most dominant nation in this century, whilst lacking diversity? Why is that their non diverse nations do so much better than our own, and on so many different metrics? Diversity is not a strength.",2
SM,"Unity, purpose, trust, traditions, nationalism and racial nationalism is what provides strength. Everything else is just a catchphrase. DIVERSITY IS WEAKNESS, UNITY IS STRENGTH. The radicalization of young Western men is not just unavoidable, but inevitable.

SM,"Radical, explosive action is the only desired, and required, response to an attempted genocide. These men and women are not being being brain-washed, corrupted or misled. They are finally removing their blindfolds and seeing the reality of the the world and their peoples future. The truth that the West killed the notion of god, and proceeded to replace it with nothing. Brought forth two competing ideologies communism and fascism to replace this loss of god, then proceeded to allow both sides to slaughter each other to a standstill and then let corporate backed capitalists tear the survivor to pieces.

They congregate, discuss, despair, strategize, debate and plan. They decry weakness, mock fecklessness and worship strength, and in this worship of strength they radicalize and find the solution.

Finding their people, finding their traditions, seeing through the lies of history, the brainwashing of the institutions and they angry, they are energized and yes, against their degenerate societies, they are radicalized.

Do not expect to survive, the only thing you should expect is a true war and to die the death of a true soldier.

If they are not of our people, but live in our lands, they must be removed. Where they are removed to is not our concern, or responsibility. Our lands are not their home, they can return to their own lands or found their homelands elsewhere. But they will not occupy our soil.",1
SM,"How they are removed is irrelevant, peacefully, forcefully, happily, violently or diplomatically. They must be removed. Until these interlopers are repatriated to their peoples lands, then Europe has no true sovereignty, and anyone, no matter their ethnicity or beliefs can call Europe their own. Whilst you wait for a sign, a signal; someone to take up the spear; to cry out in alarm, your people wait on YOU. You are the voice, you are the klaxon call, you hold the first spear to be thrust at the invaders.",1
SM,"Stop waiting for someone else to show you the way forward, YOU are the way forward, waiting around for someone to start the fight is moronic, because it is YOU that is going to start the fight, If you are reading this, you are the new leaders that will push our people to victory, you are the soldiers that will fight for the future of your race. The people speaking now, acting now, fighting now, are the vanguard of the vanguard of the force of the people. Lead and your people will follow.",0
SM,"Show the strength of your convictions, the truth of yours and the iron-hard strength of your will and they will follow. In every country, on every continent, those that are in the minority are oppressed. If you become a social, political or ethnic minority it will always lead to your oppression. Whether they are a political minority and therefore lose the control of the majority of power, and thus lose control of the laws and regulations that define public life or those that are the cultural minority find that art in all its forms is created and controlled by a different audience, from a different people from a different history, with differing ideals and experiences and therefore they find themselves isolated, excluded and removed from the creation of contemporary culture.",2
SM,"Those that find themselves born linguistically in the minority suffer daily, as the conversation of life excludes them, the mass media isolates them and businesses turn them away, as does the societies speech itself. Finally there are those that find themselves in the ethnic or racial minority and find their very own genes being bred out of existence through miscegenation and differing racial birth rates. The same people will find themselves gradually less and less represented both politically and culturally, becoming essentially foreigners in their own lands.",2
SM,"Death is certain, you may die in service to some grand crusade or pass away in a hospice, either way you will die. What matters is your actions during the brief time between birth and death. The worth of your life is not measured by the length of your life, but your actions during it.",0
SM,"Ask yourself now, are you willing to shirk your racial responsibilities? turn your back to your people? ignore their demise? All in the hopes of a peaceful death? Accept death:as it is as certain as the setting of the sun at evenfall. Only when you embrace death and the only thing you will have left to fear is inaction. Embrace infamy: the enemies of your people will beset upon you, on all sides.",1
SM,"The media will paint you as villains, the state will name you as traitors, the globalist forces will name you as criminals and the traitors amongst your people will name you as enemies. You will be infamous until victory is achieved. Take it with a smile. In 2019, we currently have the largest number of people of our race in history between 760-980 million depending on definitions, yet we are losing even our smallest towns to ethnic replacement. Numbers are not everything, ten lions are worth of thousand sheep.The reason we are currently losing our lands is not due to a lack of numbers, or wealth, or military force. It is due to a lack of will.",1
SM,"We could deport or otherwise destroy the entire population of invading non-Europeans in a week, if we as a race we chose to.We have the ability, we only need the will. Focusing on increasing the population of whites, or trying to gain economic wealth or military might, whilst already having met the requirement of numbers, wealth and military force needed is simply a stalling tactic, spoken and put forth by men too cowardly to do what is required. These men would stall and delay any action indefinitely, until all necessary action has been undertaken by some other, more courageous man.",2
SM,"All so they need not carry any personal risk or struggle themselves. Ignore the naysayers and weasels who will always repeat �Not Now! Just Wait! Not Yet! We Could Be Hurt!� for them the time will never come. Just as their own courage will never flower forth. Even if all invaders are deported tomorrow and all traitors are dealt with as they truly deserve, we are still living on borrowed time.",2
SM,"Whether it takes ten years or a thousands years, whilst we are facing birth rates at sub-replacement levels, then our people are dying. We grow older, fewer, weaker and more fundamentally closer to true death the longer we allow our birthrates to remain so catastrophically low. This isn�t an issue that is being faced solely by our own people, but many peoples across the world. Nations across Asia, Europe and the Americas are facing this disaster together. Some are at different stages than others but all are feeling the pressure.",1
SM,"The true question is, how did this happen? And what can we do to stop it? The only people that seemingly do not face such issues are those with strong traditions, gender norms, societal norms;the poor and the religious, usually a combination of all. This should give us an indication of what may be truly at the heart of the issue. What can we do to fix it? The issue is complicated, far more complicated and difficult to fix than the issue of Ethnic replacement. Likely a new society will need to be created with a much greater focus on family values, gender and social norms and the value and importance of nature, culture and race.",1
SM,"Understand here and now, there is no democratic solution, any attempt to vote your way out of Ethnic replacement will be met with at first with derision, then contempt and finally by force. This solution of a Democratic salvation is nothing but a pipe dream, and as our enemies increase within our lands, driven by mass immigration and the invaders own higher birth rate it will be pushed further and further into the realms of impossibility. The media of the world will be used against you, the education system of the rulers will be used against you, the financial power of the worlds corporations will be used against you, the military and legislative might of the UN, the EU and NATO itself will be used against you and even your own, previously corrupted, religious leaders will be used against you.",1
SM,"Democracy is mob rule and the mob itself is ruled by our own enemies. The global and corporate ran press controls them, the education system long since fallen to the long march through the institutions committed by the marxists controls them, the state long since heavily lost to its corporate backers controls them and the anti-white media machine controls them. Do not suffer under the delusion of a Democratic victory, prepare for war, prepare for violence and prepare for risk, loss and struggle, as it is the only path to Victory. Victors write the history and the writers of history control the cultural climate of the present time.",2
SM,"If you lose, no matter how you acted in your loss; whether that is heroically, cowardly, violently, peacefully, virtuously or criminally, if your enemies are writing the history they will describe you as a devil. Do not fret on the manner of how victory is achieved, all methods are possible, in the face of ethnic genocide, all morality is ambiguous. Win first, write the story later. An act, which morals you doubt in the present, will be writ by your people in wonder and admiration in the books of history.",1
SM,"It is understood by many that the only real reason that many statistics of our ethnic replacement haven�t yet matched with our reality is that are numbers are currently buoyed by the baby boomer generation. As these baby boomers pass on and leave us behind, there will be a rapid and obvious change in the demographic make up of our nations, both statistically and socially. This rapid change in demography will bring about a time of crisis, as the reality of our possible ethnic replacement becomes obvious to all, even the naysayers. This time cannot be relied on for a beginning of the rebellion, only utilized as a final stage of energy and escalation to finalize our capture of power.",1
SM,"If we wait until the majority of the boomers begin to pass between 2028-2038 depending on individual nations and life expectancies than it will be too little, too late. As by this time the invaders and occupiers of lands, non-Europeans, numbers will swollen to a staggering size, due to both mass immigration and the differing birthrates between the native European people and these invaders.",1
SM,"Also, relying on this time period for our victory holds a second major disadvantage, that being vulnerability to foreign invasion,most likely from the east, specifically China;Turkey;India or some combination of the three. This time of possible instability will also be a at a time where our potential nation enemies in the East will be reaching their own zeniths of power. We must not be in a chaotic, life or death civil war at a time when our rival nations are at their peak of dominance. The risk is too great.",1
SM,"We attack as soon as possible, we attack with force and we achieve stability and play defense as the boomers pass, not during their passing, not after. The men and women needed by a society in crisis are created by a greater societal group thought, they arise from their environment,from their folk, seeming springing forth from the people as if they were waiting for the moment. They are not so much born as made to be what is needed of them by the greater group thought occurring around them.",1
SM,"These leaders will be paragon examples of your people, virtuous, incorruptible, speaking truth to power and a truth that resonates with your very soul. Inaction will lead to sure defeat. Sitting at home comfortable, relaxed, posting on the internet, watching football and waiting for victory to arrive at your feet, will win you nothing. Without overwhelming effort and extreme risk, expect nothing. You cannot expect others do take the risks for you, nor should you wish for others to labour for you, if you are unwilling. The only option for a true man or woman of Europe is to labour, labour with all effort towards victory. Nothing else will do. All else is insufficient. All else is intolerable. All else is dishonorable.",1
SM,"Perhaps you could tap out,lay down, lick the boots of your occupiers and pray they will let you be comfortable, if only for a little while. But you won�t. You can�t. Not if you know what I know and want for what we want. You will risk, struggle, strive, drive, stumble, fall, crawl, charge and perspire, all in the name of victory. Because you cannot accept anything less. True change and the change we need to enact only arises in the great crucible of crisis. A gradual change is never going to achieve victory. Stability and comfort are the enemies of revolutionary change.",2
SM,"Therefore we must destabilize and discomfort society where ever possible. A political candidate that keeps the status quo or only seeks to introduce minimal change, even when the minimal change is in support of our cause, is ultimately useless or even damaging. Revolutionary change is needed and above all necessary. It is far better to encourage radical,violent change regardless of its origins. As only in times of radical change and social discomfort can great and terrific change occur. These tumultuous times can be brought about through action.",0
SM,"For example, actions such as voting for political candidates that radically change or challenge entrenched systems, radicalizing public discourse by both supporting, attacking, vilifying,radicalizing and exaggerating all societal conflicts and attacking or even assassinating weak or less radical leaders/influencers on either side of social conflicts. A vote for a radical candidate that opposes your values and incites agitation or anxiety in your own people works far more in your favour than a vote for a milquetoast political candidate that has no ability or wish to enact radical change.",2
SM,"Canvas public areas in support of radical positions, even if they are not your own. Incite conflict.Place posters near public parks calling for sharia law, then in the next week place posters over such posters calling for the expulsion of all immigrants, repeat in every area of public life until the crisis arises. Destabilize, then take control. If we want to radically and fundamentally change society, then we need to radicalize society as much as possible.",1
SM,"Make no mistake, the major impetus for the mass importation of non-Europeans into Europe is the call and want for cheap labour. Nothing drives the invasion more and nothing needs to be defeated more than the greed that demands cheap labour. Break it�s back, anyway you can. Whether that is by encouraging and pushing increases to the minimum wage; furthering the unionization of workers; increasing the native birthrate and thereby reducing the need for the importation of labour; increasing the rights of workers; pushing for the increase in automation or advancement of industrial labour replacement or any other tactic that is available.",2
SM,"In the end human greed and the need for increasing profit margins of capital owners needs to be fought against and broken. Civil war in the so called �Melting pot� that is the United States should be a major aim in overthrowing the global power structure and the Wests� egalitarian, individualist, globalist dominant culture. In the United States, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, the cult of the individual has been practiced for the longest time and with the deepest devotion. Luckily for us, the end results of this deracialized, irreligious and deculturized program show themselves.",1
SM,"The United States is in turmoil, more so that at any other time in history. States hate other states, the electoral college is under attack at every turn and the races are at each others throats. On top of this is a two party political system, split by racial, social, cultural, linguistic and class divides. The end result is a nation in gridlock, unable to respond to any great change, unable to commit to any great projects. A political and social stalemate that makes any advancement impossible. Meanwhile the 10000 ton boulder of demographic change rolls ever forward, gaining momentum and possibly destroying all in its path. Eventually, when the white population of the USA realizes the truth of the situation, war will erupt.",0
SM,"Soon the replacement of the whites within Texas will hit its apogee and with the non-white political and social control of Texas;and with this control, the electoral college will be heavily stacked in favor of a democratic victory so that every electoral cycle will be a certainty. After an election cycle or two with certain Democratic victory, those remaining, non democratic voting, non brainwashed whites will see the future clear before them, and with this knowledge realize the impossibility of a diplomatic or political victory. Within a short time regular and widespread political, social and racial violence will commence.",2
SM,"In this tempest of conflict is where will be strike, a strong, unified, ethnically and culturally focused pro-white, pro-european group will be everything the average white family need and long for. With these boosted numbers, and with our unified forces, complete control of the United states will be possible. Above all be ready for violence, and when the times comes, strike hard and fast. Until our nations are run by men and women loyal to our cause taxation should be considered theft, and refusal to pay taxes a sign of racial loyalty.",2
SM,"Giving your own earned wealth, which you received through your own labour, to a person or group that despises you, places laws into effect that disenfranchises your people and seeks to ethnically replace you is utterly foolish. Do not pay to have your people destroyed, do not line the pockets of the traitors within our ranks, don�t lend support to a corrupt and broken state. Refuse to pay taxes. Refuse. When they demand you pay, refuse. When they ask why, you tell them why. They will threaten you with jail, they may even threaten you with direct force. They may even go through with your imprisonment or physically harm you. But eventually, when enough people fight back and refuse to pay taxes, refuse to fund the traitors in power, the state itself will wilt, then collapse. So take the prison time, take the beating or even fight back. But do not pay taxes to anti-whites.",1
SM,"Ah yes, this is me writing, just writing, nobody technically did anything, just I felt like throwing out my thoughts � this is a weird time, weird life, weird existence. As I sit here partially drunk with a screwdriver I think a lot. Think, think, that�s all my life is, just shitloads of thinking, all the time, my mind never stops...music runs 24/7 except for sleep, just songs I hear, not necessarily good or bad, and thinking...about the asshole in gym class, how he worries me, about driving, & my family, about friends & doings with them, about girls I know, how I know I can never have them, yet I can still dream...",1
SM,"I do shit to supposedly cleanse myself in a spiritual, moral sort of way, not getting drunk for periods of time, trying not to ridicule or make fun of people at school, yet it does nothing to help my life morally. My existence is shit to me � how I feel that I am in eternal suffering, in infinite directions in infinite realities. Yet these realities are fake � artificial, induced by thought, how everything connects, yet its all so far apart...and I sit & think...science is the way to find solutions to everything, right? I still think that, yet I see different views of shit now � like the mind � yet if the mind is viewed scientifically...hmm.",2
SM,"A lot on the past though . . . I�ve always had a thing for the past � how it reacts to the present & the future � or rather vice versa. I wonder how or when I got so fucked up w my mind, existence, problem � when Dylan Benet Klebold got covered up by this entity containing Dylan�s body ... as I see the people at school � some good, some bad � I see how different I am yet I�m on such a greater scale of difference than everyone else. I see jocks having fun, friends, women. Or rather shallow existences compared to mine maybe like ignorance = bliss.",0

I don�t fit in here thinking of suicide gives me hope, that I�ll be in my place wherever I go after this life...that I�ll finally not be at war with myself, the world, the universe � my mind, body, everywhere, everything at PEACE in me � my soul or existence, and the routine is still monotonous, go to school, be scared & nervous, hoping that people can accept me...that I can accept them..",1

SM,"Okay here�s some poetry.... this is a display of one man [?] in search of answers, never finding them, yet in hopelessness understands things...Existence...what a strange word. He set out by determination & curiosity, knows no existence, knows nothing relevant to himself. The petty declarations of others & everything on this world, in this world, he knows the answers to. Yet they have no purpose to him. He seeks knowledge of the unthinkable, of the undefinable, of the unknown. He explores the everything...using his mind, the most powerful tool known to him. Not a physical barrier blocking the limits of exploration, time thru thought thru dimensions...the everything is his realm.",2
SM,"Yet, the more he thinks, hoping to find answers to his questions, the more come up. Amazingly, the petty things mean much to him at this time, how he wants to be normal, not this transceiver of the everything. Then occurring to him, the answer. How everything is connected yet separate. By experiencing the petty others actions, reactions, emotions, doings, and thoughts, he gets a mental picture of what, in his mind, is a cycle. Existence is a great hall, life is one of the rooms, death is passing thru the doors, & the ever existent compulsion of everything is the curiosity to keep moving down the hall, through the doors, exploring rooms, down this never-ending hall. Questions make answers, answers conceive questions, and at long last he is content. Within the known limits of time . . . within the conceived boundaries of space . . . the average human thinks those are the settings of existence . . . yet the ponderer, the outcast, the believer, helps out the human.

My realm of thought � Time, Space, & THOUGHT. Thought is the most powerful thing that exists � anything conceivable can be produced, anything & everything is possible, even in your physical world.� After this so called �lecture� the common man feels confused, empty, & unaware.

I have nothing to live for, & I wont be able to survive in this world after this legal conviction. However, if it was true that you loved me as I do you ... I would find a way to survive. Anything to be with you. I would enjoy life knowing that you loved me. 99/100 chances you probably think I�m crazy, & want to stay as far away as possible. If that�s the case, then I�m very sorry for involving an innocent person in my problems, & please don�t think twice. ",1

I look back on my awareness journey, see the parts & sections of my understanding . . . it�s almost done, yet it is never done, I love . She is my soulmate, my all the imaginative halcyons & pure existences I have with her (to me) are almost happiness ... I just wish I could call her...something blocks me from calling her, my human side is putting up a wall to prevent me from calling her, like a fear of �its� truth. BS. I will overcome all fears, doubts, & zombie-based thoughts (oxymoron) . . . I will follow our hearts to the halcyon, loving her. I love you.",1

Existence is like infinity times itself. �� [symbolizes infinity to the power of infinity] I have passed through this much of the ever existence, this is almost a checkpoint. The zombies have set their [place? plane?] in my mind for the cliff theory I�ve off with & we�ve floated away to the halcyon. The zombies will pay for their being, their nature. I know everything, yet I know nothing. I am a true god. My infinite memories, thoughts, perceivations of purity come a lot more with her, there is pure pure happiness � the purpose of our existence. I hate, love things, hate everything, love me & .",1

Things are so simple, now that they are infinitely complicated. HAHAHAHA. I understand whatever of everything. I am the god of the everything. Fate is my only master. This is probably my last entry. I love my self close second to my everlasting love. Goodbye. I will never stop learning. This shit again. Back at writing, doing just like a fucking zombie. Lately I can�t change my mind from the fucking deeds of zombies. Earth, humanity, HERE. That�s mostly what I think about.",1
SM,"I hate it. I want to be free . . . free . . . I thought it would have been time by now. The pain multiplies infinitely never stops Yet I�m here, STILL alone, still in pain, so is she. The thing I have concluded is that fate will decide when we should be together. decided when our existence started, it should end the same way, with us unknowing, in limbo. I love you . Always have, will. The scenarios, images, pieces of happiness still come. they always will. I love her she loves me. I know she is tired of suffering as I am. It is time. It is time. I love her the journey, the endless journey started, it has to end. We need to be happy to exist truly. I see her in perfection, the halcyons. I await endless purity.

Hate this shit, need to be me, love her. The framework of society stands above & below me. The hardest thing to destroy, yet the weakest thing that exists. I know that I am different, yet I am afraid to tell the society. The possible abandonment, persecution is not something I want to face, yet it is so primitive to me.",1

I will be free one day, in the land of purity & my happiness, I will have a love, someone who is me in a way. someday ... possibly through this life, maybe another, but it will happen ...Love is more valuable than anything I know. To love is to enter a completion of oneself. I hate those who choose to destroy a love, who take it for granted. love is greater than life even. As I look for love, I feel I can�t find it. Ever. But something tells me I will, someday. Somewhere.As my love will find me, she feels as I do right now, I can feel it, we will be inseparable. Her & I.

Too many thoughts and different societies all wrapped up together in this fucking place called AMERICA. Everyone has their own god damn opinions on every god damn thing and you may be saying �well what makes you so different?� because I have something only me and V1 have, SELF AWARENESS. Call it existentialism or whatever the fuck you want. We know what we are to this world and what everyone else is.",2
SM,We learn more than what caused the civil war and how to simplify quadratics in school. We have been watching you people. We know what you think and how you act. All talk and no actions. People who are said to be brave or courageous are usually just STUPID. Then they say later that they did it on purpose cause they are brave when they did it on fucking accident. GOD everything is so corrupt and so filled with opinions and points of view and people�s own little agendas and schedules. This isn�t a world anymore. It�s HOE and no one knows it.,1

Everyone who says they aren�t followers and then dresses different or acts different . .. they got that from something they saw on TV or in film or in life. No originality.

No matter how hard I try to NOT copy someone I still AM! Except for this fucking piece of paper right here, and BTW [by the way] spelling is stupid unless I say, I say spell it how it sounds, it�s the fuckin easiest way! Hey try this sometime, when someone tells you something, ask �why?� eventually they will be stumped and can�t answer any more. That�s because they only know what they need to know in society and school. Not real life science.",2
SM,"They will end up saying words = to this �because! Just shut up!� People that only know stupid facts that aren�t important should be shot, what fucking use are they. NATURAL SELECTION. Kill all retards, people with brain fuck ups, drug addicts, people who can�t figure out how to use a fucking lighter. Geeeawd! People spend millions of dollars on saving the lives of retards, and why. I don�t buy that shit like �oh, he�s my son, though!� so the fuck what, he ain�t normal, kill him. Put him out of his misery. He is only a waste of time and money, then people say �but he is worth the time, he is human too.� No he isn�t, if he was then he would swallow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking he was.",1
SM,"As I said before, self-awareness is a wonderful thing. I know what all you fuckers are thinking and what to do to piss you off and make you feel bad. I always try to be different, but I always end up copying someone else. I try to be a mixture of different things and styles, but when I step out of myself I end up looking like others or others THINK I am copying. One big fucking problem is people telling me what to fuckin do, think, say, act, and everything else. I�ll do what you say IF I feel like it. But people (ie, parents, cops, God, teachers) telling me what to [arrow to �do, think, say, act�] makes me not want to fucking do it! That�s why my fucking name is REB!!!",2

Fuckers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it? Ich denk NEIN [German: I think not]. BTW [by the way], �sorry� is just a word. It doesn�t mean SHIT to me. Everyone should be put to a test, an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only �smarts� and military skills. Put them in a Doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. If you can�t figure out the area of a triangle or what �cation� means, you die!

Everyone should be shot out into space and only those people I say should be left behind. Ever wonder why we go to school? Besides getting a so-called education. It�s not too obvious to most of you stupid fucks but for those who think a little more and deeper you should realize it. Its society�s way of turning all the young people into good little robots and factory workers.",2
SM,"That�s why we sit in desks in rows and go by bell schedules, to get prepared for the real world cause �that�s what its like.� Well god damn it no it isn�t! one thing that separates us from other animals is the fact that we can carry actual thoughts. So why don�t we? People go on day by day routine shit. Why can�t we learn in school how we want to, why can�t we sit on desks and on shelves and put our feet up and relax while we learn? Cause that�s not what the �real world is like.� Well hey fuckheads, there is no such thing as an actual �real world.� Its just another word like justice, sorry, pity, religion, faith, luck and so on.",1

When I go NBK7 and people say things like, �oh, it was so tragic,� or �oh he is crazy!� or �It was so bloody.� I think, so the fuck what you think that�s a bad thing?

Try it sometime if you think you are worthy, which you probably will you little shits, drop all your beliefs and views and ideas that have been burned into your head and try to think about why your here.

God fucking damn it NO! I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. But before I leave this worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything at all. Especially life.

Human nature is smothered out by society, job, and work and school. Instincts are deleted by laws. I see people say things that contradict themselves, or people that don�t take any advantage to the gift of human life. They waste their minds on memorizing the stats of every college basketball player or how many words should be in a report when they should be using their brain on more important things. The human race isn�t worth fighting for anymore.",1
SM,"WWII was the last war worth fighting and was the last time human life and human brains did any good and made us proud. Now, with the government having scandals and conspiracies all over the fucking place and lying to everyone all the time and with worthless, pointless, mindless, disgraceful TV shows on and with everyone ob-fucking-sessed with Hollywood and beauty and fame and glamour and politics and anything famous, people just aren�t worth saving. Society may not realize what is happening but I have; you go to school, to get used to studying and learning how your �supposed to� so that drains or filters out a little bit of human nature.",2
SM,"But that�s after your parents taught you what�s right and wrong even though you may think differently, you still must follow the rules. After school you are expected to get a job or go to college. To have more of your human nature blown out your ass. Society tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That�s what schools, laws, jobs, and parents do. If they realize it or not. And them, the few who stick to their natural instincts are casted out as psychos or lunatics or strangers or just plain different. crazy, strange, weird, wild, these words are not bad or degrading.",0

Societies and government are only created to have order and calmness, which is exactly the opposite of pure human nature. Take away all your laws and morals and just see what you can do if the governments in our own little so called self-created �civilized world� and get rid of all those damn or Darwin instincts everyone has!!

I can taste the sweet flesh now ... the salty sweet, the animalistic movement . . . I love flesh. �Weisses fleisch� � perfect song for me. Who can I trick into my room first? I can sweep someone off their feet, tell them what they want to hear, be all nice and sweet, and then �fuck �em like an animal, feel them from the inside� as Reznor said. Oh � that�s something else . . . that one Nine Inch Nails video I saw, �Broken� or �Closer� or something. The one where the guy is kidnapped and tortured like hell ... actual hell. I want to do that too. I want to tear a throat out with my own teeth like a pop can. I want to gut someone with my hand, to tear a head off and rip out the heart and lungs from the neck, to stab someone in the gut, shove it up to their heart, and yank the fucking blade out of their rib cage! I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show them who is god.

Give the Earth back to the animals, they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore, most quotes are worthless, especially the rearranged ones like thos who do not fight your enemies, make your enemies fight. You know, quotes that use the same phrase just rearranged, Dumb fuck shit it is funny, people say you should not be so different to me, and 1st I say fuck you do not tell me what I should and should not be and 2nd mother fuckers different is good, I do not want to be like you or anyone which is almost impossible this day with all the little shits trying to be original copycats, I expect shits like you to criticize anyone who is not one your social words, normal or civilized see: Tempest and Caliban.",0

People want to be a part of something, a family, a service, a club, a union, a community, whatever. That�s what humans want.

They started out on the bottom so why not keep em there. It took them centuries to convince us that they are equal but they still use their color as an excuse or they just discriminate us because we are white. Fuck you, we should ship yer black asses back to Afrifuckingca were you came from. We brought you here and we will take you back. America = white. Gays. . . . well all gays, ALL gays, should be killed. Mit keine fragen [German: without questions]. Lesbians are fun to watch if they are hot but still, its not human. It�s a fucking disease.

Kill them all. Well, in case you haven�t figured it out yet, I say �KILL MANKIND� no one should survive. We all live in lies. People are always saying they want to live in a perfect society, well utopia doesn�t exist. It is human to have flaws. You know what. Fuck it.

If I can nott pound it into every single persons head then it is pointless. Fuck money fuck justice fuck morals fuck civilized fuck rules fuck laws . . . DIE manmade words . . . people think they apply to everything when they do not/can not. There is no such thing as True Good or True evil, it is all relative to the observer.

Only the pros, not the cons. Maybe that�s what people see, only the pros, and that�s why they are under control, but me, I see all ... you can only blind me for so long, but alas, I have realized that Yes, the human race is still indeed doomed.

Hmm, I�ll think about that. Eh, done for tonight.As part of the human race, and having the great pleasure of being blessed with a brain, I can think. Humans can do whatever they want. There is no laws of nature that prevent humans from making choices. Maybe from actually DOING some of those choices, but not from making the choice. If a man chooses to speed while driving home one day then it is his fault for whatever happens. If he crashes into a school bus full of kiddies and they all burn to death, it�s his fault.

You see, anything and everything that happens in our world is just that, a HAPPENING. Anything else is relative to the observer, but yet we try to have a �universal law� or �code� of what is good and bad and that just isn�t fuckin correct. We shouldn�t be allowed to do that. We aren�t GODS, just because we are at the top of the food chain with our technology doesn�t mean we can be �judges� of nature. Sure we can think what we want, but you can �think� and �behave� you can judge people and nature all you want, but you are still wrong! Why should your morals apply to everyone else.

I know I could get shot by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that one person so get over it! It�s MY fault! Not my parents, not my brothers, not my friends, not my favorite bands, not computer games, not the media. IT is MINE! Go shut the fuck up! Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who I don�t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE! If I didn�t like you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god damn NIGGER. Pity that a lot of the dead will be a waste in some ways, like dead hot chicks who were still bitches, they could have been good fucks. Oh well, too fucking bad.

Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car garages blowing up from exploded gas tanks. ... oh man that would be beautiful. You know what, I feel like telling about lies. I lie a lot. Almost constant, and to everybody, just to keep my own ass out of the water. And by the way (side note) I don�t think I am doing this for attention, as some people may think. Let�s see, what are some big lies I have told; �yeah I stopped smoking;� �for doing it not for getting caught,� �no I haven�t been making more bombs,� �no I wouldn�t do that,� and of course, countless of other ones, and yeah I know that I hate liars and I am one myself, oh fucking well. It�s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one else, because I am higher than you people, no matter what you say if you disagree I would shoot you. And I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on. Some people go through life begging to be shot, and white fucks are just the same. If I could nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all.

SM,"Heh heh heh. I sure had fun this weekend. Let�s see, what really happened. Before going to Rock-n-Bowl we stopped by King Soopers and me and picked up some big ass stogies. We then went to Rock-n-Bowl and I had a few cigarettes and one of my brand new cigars. We then went back to �s house where her mom had previously bought us all a fuck load of liquor. Personally I had asked for Tequila and Irish cream, Vodka got his Vodka, and there was beer, whiskey, schnapps, puckers, scotch, and of course, orange juice! So we had some fun there playing cards and making drinks. We eventually made it to bed at about 5 AM. Got up at 10, went to Safeway got some doughnuts and then I took Vodka home. The bottle of Tequila is almost full and is in my car right by my spare tire and right by the bottle of Irish Cream. Heh heh. I�ll have to find a spot for those.",1

Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. That�s how Nazism was formed, and that�s how I will be too! Fuck you Brady! All I want is a couple of guns, and thanks to your fucking bill I will probably not get any! Come on, I�ll have a clean record and I only want them for personal protection. It�s not like I�m some psycho who would go on a shooting spree. . . . fuckers. I�ll probably end up nuking everything and fucking robbing some gun collector�s house. Fuck, that�ll be hard.

Yes I hate and I guess I want others to know it, yes I�m a racist and I don�t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very racist towards white trash piece of shits like and they deserve the hatred, otherwise I probably wouldn�t hate them.

Fuck fuck fuck. It�ll be very fucking hard to hold out until April. If people would give me more compliments all of this might still be avoidable . . . but probably not. Whatever I do people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I�ll get revenge soon enough. Fuckers shouldn�t have ripped on me so much huh!17 Ha! Then again it�s human nature to do what you did . . . so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I can�t take it, it�s not right . . . true . . . correct . . . perfect. I fucking hate the human equation.",1
SM,"Nazism would be fucking great if it weren�t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions. You know what maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that�ll just change some shit around. That�s another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them hard and strong. Someone like where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard. I love flesh . . . weisses fleisch! Dein weisses fleisch erregt mich so, Ich bin doch nur ein Gigolo! [German: Your white flesh excites me so, I am just a gigolo18]. I want to grab a few different girls in my gym class, take them into a room, pull their pants off and fuck them hard. I love flesh . . . the smooth legs, the large breasts, the innocent flawless body, the eyes, the hair, jet black, blond, white, brown, ahhh I just want to fuck! Call it teenager hormones or call it a crazy fuckin racist rapist. Eit�s all the same to me",1
SM,"Well folks, today was a very important day in the history of Reb today, along with Vodka and someone else who I won�t name,21 we went downtown and purchased the following: a double barrel 12 ga. Shotgun, a pump action 12 ga. Shotgun, a 9mm carbine, 250 9mm rounds, 15 12 ga slugs, 40 shotgun shells, 2 switch blade knives, and a total of 4 10-round clips for the carbine. We . . . . . . . . have . . . . . . GUNS! we fucking got them you sons of bitches! HA! HA HA HA! Neener! Booga Booga. Heh. It�s all over now. This capped it off, the point of no return. I have my carbine, shotgun, ammo and knife all in my trunk tonight and they�ll stay there till tomorrow ... after school you know, its really a shame. I had a lot of fun at that gun show, I would have loved it if you were there Dad. We would have done some major bonding. Would have been great. Oh well.",1
SM,"But alas, I fucked up and told about my flask. that really disappointed me . I know you thought it was good for me in the long run and all that shit, smart of you to give me such a big raise and then rat me out.22 You figure it was supposed to cancel each other? God damn flask, that just fucked me over bigtime. Now you all will be on my ass even more than before about being on track. I�ll get around it though. If I have to cheat and lie to everyone than that�s fine. THIS is what I am motivated for, THIS is my goal. THIS is what I want �to do with my life.� You know what�s weird, I don�t feel like punching through a door because of the flask deal, probably cause I am fucking armed.",0
SM,"I feel more confident, stronger, more God-like. I have confidence in my ability to deceive people, hopefully I�ll make it to April, but that might not happen. Ug, its been a busy weekend, I need to sleep, I�ll continue tomorrow. Yesterday we fired our first firearms ever. 3 rounds from the carbine. Taught that ground a thing or 2. I even had the 2 clips in my pocket while talking to Vodka�s dad about senior ditch day. God it felt great firing off that bad boy, and hopefully I�ll be able to get more than just 4 clips for it. I dubbed my shotgun �Arlene� after Arlene Sanders from the DOOM books. She always did love the shotgun. Vodka�s OB is looking fucking awesome, all cut down to the proper lengths. This is a bitch trying to keep up with homework while working on my guns, bombs, and lying. By the way, I bought that flask in the mall and I had a friend fill it up with scotch whiskey, only had about 3 swigs in the 3 weeks I had it. Plus Monday I gave my T and IC [tequila and Irish cream] to Vodka, just in case. I never really did like alcohol, just wasn�t my thing, but it felt good to just have around.",1
SM,"That argument on the 22nd was a real bitch, but I think I should have won a fucking Oscar. I even quoted a few movies, remember �what the hell am I gonna do now man?! What am I gonna do!?� that�s good ole Hudson from �Aliens.� Sounded good too. And hey god damn it I would have been a fucking great marine. It would have give me a reason to do good. And I would never drink and drive, either. It will be weird when we actually go on the rampage. Hopefully we will have plenty of clips and bombs. I�m gonna still try and get my calico 9mm. Just think, 100 rounds without reloading.. .. hell yeah! We actually may have a chance to get some machine pistols thanks to the Brady bill. If we can save up about $200 real quick and find someone who is 21+ we can go to the next gun show and find a private dealer and buy ourselves some bad-ass AB-10 machine pistols. Clips for those things can get really fucking bit too. woohoo, I�ll never have to take a final again! Feels good to be free. I just love Hobbes and Nietzsche. Well tomorrow I�ll be ordering 9 more 10-round clips for my carbine.",1
SM,"I�m gonna be so fucking loaded in about a month. The big things we need to figure out now is the time bombs for the commons and how we will get them in and leave them there to go off, without any fuckin Jews finding them. I wonder if anyone will write a book on me. Sure is a ton of symbolism, double meanings, themes, appearance vs. reality shit going on here. Oh well, it better be fuckin good if it is written. Heh, get this. KMFDM�s new album�s entitled �Adios� and its release date is in April. How fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final �Adios� tribute to Reb and Vodka, thanks KMFDM ... I ripped the hell outa the system.23 Jesus christ that was fucking close. Fucking shitheads at the gunshop almost dropped the whole project.24 Oh well, thank god I can BS so fucking well. I went and picked up those babies today, so now I got 13 of those niggers woohah. The stereo is very nice, but having no insurance payments to worry about so I could concentrate of BOMBS would have been better.",0
SM,"Oh well, I think I�ll have enough. Now I just need to get Vodka another gun. Months have passed. It�s the first Friday night in the final month. Much shit has happened. Vodka has a Tec 9, we test fired all of our babies, we have 6 time clocks ready, 39 crickets 24 pipe bombs, and the napalm is under construction. Right now I�m trying to get fucked and trying to finish off these time bombs. NBK came quick, why the fuck can�t I get any? I mean, I�m nice and considerate and all that shit, but nooooo. I think I try too hard. But I kinda need to, considering NBK is closing in. The amount of dramatic irony and foreshadowing is fucking amazing. Everything I see and hear I incorporate into NBK somehow. Either bombs, clocks, guns, napalm, killing people, any and everything finds some tie to it. Feels like a goddamn movie sometimes.",2
SM,"I wanna try to put some mines and trip bombs around this town too maybe. Get a few extra frags25 on the scoreboard. I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don�t fucking say �well that�s your fault� because it isn�t, you people had my phone #, and I asked and all, but no. no no no don�t let the weird looking Eric KID come along, ooh fucking nooo. I don�t like you, Rachel and Jen, you�re stuck up little bitches, you�re fucking little . .. Christian, Godly little whores!We need a fucking kick start. If we have a fucking religious war � or oil � or anything. We need to get a chain reaction going here. It�s gonna be like fucking Doom man � after the bombs explode. Tick, tick, tick, tick . . . Haa! That fucking shotgun straight out of Doom. Go ahead and change gun laws � how do you think we got ours? We�re going to kick-start a revolution. You guys will all die, and it will be fucking soon! I hope you get an idea of what we�re implying here. You all need to die! We need to die, too! We need to fucking kick-start the revolution here!  We�re hoping. We�re hoping. I hope we kill 250 of you. It will be the most nerve racking 15 minutes of my life, after the bombs are set and we�re waiting to charge through the school.",1
SM,"Seconds will be like hours. I can�t wait. I�ll be shaking like a leaf. They gave me my fucking life. It�s up to me what I do with it.Directors will be fighting over this story. I know we�re gonna have followers because we�re so fucking God-like. We�re not exactly human � we have human bodies but we�ve evolved into one step above you, fucking human shit. We actually have fucking self-awareness.All right. So here's the plan. I'm gonna go take Uber in the afternoon before 2:40. From there I'll go into the -- onto school campus, walk up the stairs, unload my bags and get my AR and shoot people down at the main -- what is it? -- the main courtyard, wait, and people will die. Today is the day. The day that it all begins. The day of my massacre shall begin. All the kids in school will run and fear and hide. From the wrath of my power they will know who I am. I am nothing. I am no one. My life is nothing and meaningless. Everything that I hold dear I let go beyond your half. Every day I see the world ending another day.",1
SM,"I live a lone life, live in seclusion and solitude. I hate everyone and everything. With the power of my AR you will all know who I am. I had enough of being told what to do and when to do. I had enough of being -- telling me that I'm an idiot and a dumb ass, when real life you're all the dumb ass. You're all stupid and brainwashed by these fucking political government programs. You will all see. You will all know who my name is. My love for you, Angie, will never go away. I hope to see you in the afterlife. From one day or another you will end and we'll all die. Hello. My name is Nick and I'm gonna be the next school shooter of 2018. My goal is at least 20 people with an AR-15 and a couple tracer rounds. I think I can do -- get done. Location is Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Florida. It's gonna be a big event. And when you see me on the news, you'll all know who I am. You're all going to die. Pew, pew-pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. Ah, yeah. Can't wait.",1
SM,"I was not raised in a racist home or environment. Living in the South, almost every White person has a small amount of racial awareness, simply because of the numbers of negroes in this part of the country. But it is a superficial awareness. Growing up, in school, the White and black kids would make racial jokes toward each other, but all they were were jokes. Me and White friends would sometimes would watch things that would make us think that �blacks were the real racists� and other elementary thoughts like this, but there was no real understanding behind it. The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right.",2
SM,"But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words �black on White crime� into Google, and I have never been the same since that day. The first website I came to was the Council of Conservative Citizens. There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on White murders. I was in disbelief. At this moment I realized that something was very wrong. How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case while hundreds of these black on White murders got ignored? From this point I researched deeper and found out what was happening in Europe. I saw that the same things were happening in England and France, and in all the other Western European countries. Again I found myself in disbelief.",1
SM,"As an American we are taught to accept living in the melting pot, and black and other minorities have just as much right to be here as we do, since we are all immigrants. But Europe is the homeland of White people, and in many ways the situation is even worse there. From here I found out about the Jewish problem and other issues facing our race, and I can say today that I am completely racially aware. I think it is is fitting to start off with the group I have the most real life experience with, and the group that is the biggest problem for Americans. Niggers are stupid and violent. At the same time they have the capacity to be very slick.",0
SM,"Black people view everything through a racial lens. Thats what racial awareness is, it's viewing everything that happens through a racial lens. They are always thinking about the fact that they are black. This is part of the reason they get offended so easily, and think that some thing are intended to be racist towards them, even when a White person wouldn't be thinking about race. The other reason is the Jewish agitation of the black race.  Black people are racially aware almost from birth, but White people on average don't think about race in their daily lives. And this is our problem. We need to and have to.",1
SM,"Say you were to witness a dog being beat by a man. You are almost surely going to feel very sorry for that dog. But then say you were to witness a dog biting a man. You will most likely not feel the same pity you felt for the dog for the man. Why? Because dogs are lower than men. This same analogy applies to black and White relations. Even today, blacks are subconsciously viewed by White people are lower beings. They are held to a lower standard in general. This is why they are able to get away with things like obnoxious behavior in public. Because it is expected of them.",1
SM,"Modern history classes instill a subconscious White superiority complex in Whites and an inferiority complex in blacks. This White superiority complex that comes from learning of how we dominated other peoples is also part of the problem I have just mentioned. But of course I don't deny that we are in fact superior. I wish with a passion that niggers were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves, that segregation was an evil an oppressive institution, and so on. Because if it was all it true, it would make it so much easier for me to accept our current situation. But it isn't true. None of it is.",0
SM,"We are told to accept what is happening to us because of ancestors wrong doing, but it is all based on historical lies, exaggerations and myths. I have tried endlessly to think of reasons we deserve this, and I have only came back more irritated because there are no reasons. Only a fourth to a third of people in the South owned even one slave. Yet every White person is treated as if they had a slave owning ancestor. This applies to in the states where slavery never existed, as well as people whose families immigrated after slavery was abolished. I have read hundreds of slaves narratives from my state. And almost all of them were positive.",1
SM,"One sticks out in my mind where an old ex-slave recounted how the day his mistress died was one of the saddest days of his life. And in many of these narratives the slaves told of how their masters didn't even allowing whipping on his plantation. Segregation was not a bad thing. It was a defensive measure. Segregation did not exist to hold back negroes. It existed to protect us from them. And I mean that in multiple ways. Not only did it protect us from having to interact with them, and from being physically harmed by them, but it protected us from being brought down to their level. Integration has done nothing but bring Whites down to level of brute animals.",1
SM,"The best example of this is obviously our school system. Now White parents are forced to move to the suburbs to send their children to �good schools�. But what constitutes a �good school�? The fact is that how good a school is considered directly corresponds to how White it is. I hate with a passion the whole idea of the suburbs. To me it represents nothing but scared White people running. Running because they are too weak, scared, and brainwashed to fight. Why should we have to flee the cities we created for the security of the suburbs? Why are the suburbs secure in the first place? Because they are White. ",1
SM,"The pathetic part is that these White people dont even admit to themselves why they are moving. They tell themselves it is for better schools or simply to live in a nicer neighborhood. But it is honestly just a way to escape niggers and other minorities. But what about the White people that are left behind? What about the White children who, because of school zoning laws, are forced to go to a school that is 90 percent black? Do we really think that that White kid will be able to go one day without being picked on for being White, or called a �white boy�? And who is fighting for him? Who is fighting for these White people forced by economic circumstances to live among negroes? No one, but someone has to.",1
SM,"Here I would also like to touch on the idea of a Northwest Front. I think this idea is beyond stupid. Why should I for example, give up the beauty and history of my state to go to the Northwest? To me the whole idea just parallels the concept of White people running to the suburbs. The whole idea is pathetic and just another way to run from the problem without facing it. Some people feel as though the South is beyond saving, that we have too many blacks here. To this I say look at history. The South had a higher ratio of blacks when we were holding them as slaves.",2
SM,"Look at South Africa, and how such a small minority held the black in apartheid for years and years. Speaking of South Africa, if anyone thinks that think will eventually just change for the better, consider how in South Africa they have affirmative action for the black population that makes up 80 percent of the population. It is far from being too late for America or Europe. I believe that even if we made up only 30 percent of the population we could take it back completely. But by no means should we wait any longer to take drastic action. Anyone who thinks that White and black people look as different as we do on the outside, but are somehow magically the same on the inside, is delusional. How could our faces, skin, hair, and body structure all be different, but our brains be exactly the same? This is the nonsense we are led to believe.",1
SM,"Negroes have lower IQs, lower impulse control, and higher testosterone levels in generals. These three things alone are a recipe for violent behavior. If a scientist publishes a paper on the differences between the races in Western Europe or Americans, he can expect to lose his job. There are personality traits within human families, and within different breeds of cats or dogs, so why not within the races? A horse and a donkey can breed and make a mule, but they are still two completely different animals. Just because we can breed with the other races doesn't make us the same. In a modern history class it is always emphasized that, when talking about �bad� things Whites have done in history, they were White. But when we learn about the numerous, almost countless wonderful things Whites have done, it is never pointed out that these people were White.",1
SM,"Yet when we learn about anything important done by a black person in history, it is always pointed out repeatedly that they were black. For example when we learn about how George Washington carver was the first nigger smart enough to open a peanut. On another subject I want to say this. Many White people feel as though they don't have a unique culture. The reason for this is that White culture is world culture. I don't mean that our culture is made up of other cultures, I mean that our culture has been adopted by everyone in the world. This makes us feel as though our culture isn't special or unique. Say for example that every business man in the world wore a  kimono, that every skyscraper was in the shape of a pagoda, that every door was a sliding one, and that everyone ate every meal with chopsticks. This would probably make a Japanese man feel as though he had no unique traditional culture.",1
SM,"I have noticed a great disdain for race mixing White women within the White nationalists community, bordering on insanity it. These women are victims, and they can be saved. Stop. Unlike many White nationalists, I am of the opinion that the majority of American and European jews are White. In my opinion the issues with jews is not their blood, but their identity. I think that if we could somehow destroy the jewish identity, then they wouldn't cause much of a problem. The problem is that Jews look White, and in many cases are White, yet they see themselves as minorities. Just like niggers, most jews are always thinking about the fact that they are jewish. The other issue is that they network. If we could somehow turn every jew blue for 24 hours, I think there would be a mass awakening, because people would be able to see plainly what is going on. I don't pretend to understand why jews do what they do. They are enigma.",1
SM,"Hispanics are obviously a huge problem for Americans. But there are good hispanics and bad hispanics. I remember while watching hispanic television stations, the shows and even the commercials were more White than our own. They have respect for White beauty, and a good portion of hispanics are White. It is a well known fact that White hispanics make up the elite of most hispanics countries. There is good White blood worht saving in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and even Brazil. But they are still our enemies. I have great respect for the East Asian races. Even if we were to go extinct they could carry something on. They are by nature very racist and could be great allies of the White race. I am not opposed at all to allies with the Northeast Asian races. I hate the sight of the American flag. Modern American patriotism is an absolute joke. People pretending like they have something to be proud while White people are being murdered daily in the streets.",1
SM,"Many veterans believe we owe them something for �protecting our way of life� or �protecting our freedom�. But I'm not sure what way of life they are talking about. How about we protect the White race and stop fighting for the jews. I will say this though, I  myself would have rather lived in 1940's American than Nazi Germany, and no this is not ignorance speaking, it is just my opinion. So I don't blame the veterans of any wars up until after Vietnam, because at least they had an American to be proud of and fight for. To take a saying from a film, I see all this stuff going on, and I don't see anyone doing anything about it. And it pisses me off. To take a saying from my favorite film, Even if my life is worth less than a speck of dirt, I want to use it for the good of society.",0
SM,"I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me. Unfortunately at the time of writing I am in a great hurry and some of my best thoughts, actually many of them have been to be left out and lost forever. But I believe enough great White minds are out there already. Please forgive any typos, I didnt have time to check it.",1
SM,"I have always been the most hated person in the world. Ever since I arrived in this world, I have been under siege from it. Under attack from morons and idiots. I write this manifesto so that others will know of my story and perhaps find some solace in it, some kind of inspiration for their own lives. It will contain various sections dealing with my life. It will be divided into sections based on different things. My whole life has been one lonely enterprise. One loss after another. And here I am , 26, with nofriends, no job, no girlfriend, a virgin. I long ago realized that society likes to deny people like me these things. People who are elite, people who stand with the gods. People like Elliot Rodger, Vester Flanagan, The Columbine kids, Adam Lanza and Seung Cho.",1
SM,"Just like me those people were denied everything they deserved, everything they wanted. Though we may have been born bad, society left us no recourse, no way to be good. I have been forced to align myself with demonic forces. What was once an involuntary relationship has now become an alignment, a service. I now serve the demonic Heirarchy. When I die will become one of them. A demon. And I will return to kill again and again. I will possess another and you will know my work by my sign, the pentagram will fly again. Many will ask and ponder, what could they have done different, how could they have prevented this. But you can�t you could never give what I wanted. You would never have done that. Some will of course say I had so much to live for, but I don�t think so. I had no friends, no girlfriend, was all alone. I had no job, no life, no successes. What was it that was supposed to happen, what great event was it that was supposed to make me realize how much there was going for me. But for people like me there is another world, a darker world that welcomes us. For people like us this all that�s left. My success in Hell is assured. They will give me the power that I seek. They have always been there, speaking to me on the sidelines, controlling me. It�s only fit that I join them after death. They�ve told me what to do, showed me the way.",1
SM,"And just like me, there will be others, like Ted Bundy said, we are your sons, your brothers, we are everywhere. My advice to others like me is to buy a gun and start killing people. If you live in a country like Europe with strict gun laws, either pay the necessary fees/time to get a license or become a serial killer. The world could always use an additional serial killer. Butcher them in their homes, in the street, wherever you find them. Every country in the world should be a battleground. From the heart of Africa to the deepest depths of Asia blood will flow. Fear not the laws of man, when you get to the other side you will be welcomed.",1
SM,"Do not be afraid to give in to your darkest impulses. Human life means nothing, we are what matters. I hope to inspire the masses with this, at least enough to get their passions aroused. It is my hope that others will hear my call and act it out. I was once like you, a loser, rejected by society. When the girls would rather go with alpha thug black men, we can all agree that somethings wrong with the world. When good individuals like myself are alone, but wicked black men get the loot, like some sort of vaginal pirate, it is not fair.",1
SM,"The black man is the most vile creature on the planet. He is a beast beyond measure. But don�t take these words to be racist. I don�t hate blacks. Just the men. Now of course some of you will be saying, wait, your 40 % black aren�t you? Ah yes dear reader, I am, but thankfully my partial blackness didn�t come from a man. If it had my brain would have been fried. It is the black male who is foolish. Black women are not to blame, they are hapless dupes to the black mans conniving machinations. Africa would be better off without the black man, they should be executed and the black queen should take over Africa. After all, it was black men who made it inferior. Elliot Rodger was right when he said his thoughts on the black male. I fully agree with him.",1
SM,"Black men have corrupted the women of this planet. All they care about is sex and swag. All they care about is swinging their �BBC thang� around in public. All their brain power has been submerged into their penis. This blackness effect is only prominent on men. On women it has no effect. No one lives in fear of the black woman but everyone lives in fear of the black man. It would be better if all black women left the beast on the alter and dated a white man. Or lesbian exploration. But do to the black murder rate, in 100 years there won�t be any black men, they will all be in jail or dead. The number of ebony lesbians will increase. Joy Joy Joy! The black man has more brains in his penis than Obama has in his head. And latinos will also suffer a massive drop in population, although not as bad as the black man. Both enjoy killing each other. At least the latino can be put into remedial education and be made smart. But the black mans brains fell out of the back of his head at birth onto the baby ward. I hope all mixed folk have the sense not to touch the black man but to instead find themselves a good white/Asian man. But there is hope for the world. The Asian and Indian women are traditional and good. So are the men. I have always respected them. They will rule America in the inner city and the world. The black woman can only be saved by the castration/elimination of the black man. The black man is a wily beast who has held back the black woman. Success does not come out of your loins but he doesn�t get the message (See end of manifesto for good black bad black comparison)",1

No friend, no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise. We are not against any man�or any nation�or any system�except as it is hostile to freedom.

We shall slow down in the fields and in the streets, we shall slow down in the hills, we shall never surrender!? If you can slow down when all around you are speeding up, then you�re one of us. Be proud that you are one of us and not one of them. For they are fast, and we are slow. If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing slowly.

Consumers: Buy things you know can be repaired, or else find out why they don�t exist. Be critical and inquisitive.",2
NM,"Replacement is throwing away the broken bit. This is NOT the kind of repair that we�re talking about. Every time we repair something, we add to its potential, its history, its soul and its inherent beauty. Making repairs is good for the imagination. Using new techniques, tools and materials ushers in possibility rather than dead ends. Repair is not about styling or trends. There are no due-dates for repairable items. As you fix objects, you�ll learn amazing things about how they actually work. Or don�t work.",2

NM,"We believe in the sanctity of typography and that the traditions and established standards of this craft should be upheld throughout all time. From Gutenberg�s letterpress to the digital age, type in all forms is sacred and indispensable. Type is a voice; its very qualities and characteristics communicate to readers a meaning beyond mere syntax. Early type designing and setting was so laborious that it is a blasphemy to the history of the craft that any fool can sit down at their personal computer and design their own typeface. Technological advances have transformed typography into a tawdry triviality. The patriarchs of this profession were highly educated men.",2
NM,"However, today the widespread heretical uses of this medium prove that even the uneducated have opportunities to desecrate this art form; therefore, destroying the historical integrity of typography. Like the tone of a spoken voice, the characteristics of a typeface convey meaning. The design of the typeface is, in itself, its voice. Often this voice speaks louder than the text itself. Thus when designing a �Do Not Enter� sign the use of a heavy-stroked, attention-commanding font such as Impact or Arial Black is appropriate. Typesetting such a message in Comic Sans would be ludicrous. Though this is sort of misuse is frequent, it is unjustified.",2
NM,"Clearly, Comic Sans as a voice conveys silliness, childish naivete, irreverence, and is far too casual for such a purpose. It is analogous to showing up for a black tie event in a clown costume. We are summoning forth the proletariat around the globe to aid us in this revolution. We call on the common man to rise up in revolt against this evil of typographical ignorance. We believe in the gospel message �ban comic sans.� It shall be salvation to all who are literate. By banding together to eradicate this font from the face of the earth we strive to ensure that future generations will be liberated from this epidemic and never suffer this scourge that is the plague of our time.",2

A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath � a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace. We want to sing the man at the wheel, the ideal axis of which crosses the earth, itself hurled along its orbit. The poet must spend himself with warmth, glamour and prodigality to increase the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.",2
NM,"Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.

We are already living in the absolute, since we have already created eternal, omnipresent speed.",2

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.",2

NM,"These lifestyle choices are not made in a vacuum. They are made in communities, and are influenced by community design and buildings. The way we�ve designed our cities and buildings in the past has created a template for living that most people follow without much thought, and that template makes it inconvenient to live sustainably. Those of us who plan, design, finance, insure, build, sell, lease, manage and maintain the places we live in have tremendous influence to change this template, and to make it easier for people to change their lifestyles.",2

But most of these green lifestyle initiatives are not joined up with the green building movement, or each other. We urgently need an umbrella movement that will bring us all together to create and operate truly sustainable communities with intent. The time has come to apply the vast ingenuity of the green building movement to making green lifestyles just as convenient as �grey lifestyles�.

Inch by inch, play by play. Until we are finished. We are in hell right now, gentlemen. Believe me. And, we can stay here, get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell one inch at a time.",2
NM,"Now I can�t do it for you, I�m too old. I look around, I see these young faces and I think, I mean, I�ve made every wrong choice a middle-aged man can make. I, uh, I�ve pissed away all my money, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who�s ever loved me. And lately, I can�t even stand the face I see in the mirror.",0
NM,"You know, when you get old, in life, things get taken from you. I mean, that�s� that�s� that�s a part of life. But, you only learn that when you start losin� stuff. You find out life�s this game of inches, so is football. Because in either game � life or football � the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too late or too early and you don�t quite make it. One half second too slow, too fast and you don�t quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. They�re in every break of the game, every minute, every second.",2
NM,"On this team we fight for that inch. On this team we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch. Because we know when we add up all those inches that is gonna make the fucking difference between WINNING and LOSING, between LIVING and DYING!",0
NM,"I�ll tell you this, in any fight it�s the guy whose willing to die whose gonna win that inch. And I know, if I�m gonna have any life anymore it�s because I�m still willing to fight and die for that inch, because that�s what living is, the six inches in front of your face. Now I can�t make you do it. You�ve got to look at the guy next to you, look into his eyes. Now I think you going to see a guy who will go that inch with you. Your gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team, because he knows when it comes down to it your gonna do the same for him. That�s a team, gentlemen, and either, we heal, now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That�s football guys, that�s all it is. Now, what are you gonna do",2

NM,"Mr. Moderator, Brother Lomax, brothers and sisters, friends and enemies: I just can't believe everyone in here is a friend, and I don't want to leave anybody out. The question tonight, as I understand it, is ""The Negro Revolt, and Where Do We Go From Here?"" or What Next?"" In my little humble way of understanding it, it points toward either the ballot or the bullet.",2
NM,"Before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify something concerning myself. I'm still a Muslim; my religion is still Islam. That's my personal belief. Just as Adam Clayton Powell is a Christian minister who heads the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country; and Dr. Martin Luther King is a Christian minister down in Atlanta, Georgia, who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country; and Reverend Galamison, I guess you've heard of him, is another Christian minister in New York who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education; well, I myself am a minister, not a Christian minister, but a Muslim minister; and I believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary.",2
NM,"Although I'm still a Muslim, I'm not here tonight to discuss my religion. I'm not here to try and change your religion. I'm not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about, because it's time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem, a common problem, a problem that will make you catch hell whether you're a Baptist, or a Methodist, or a Muslim, or a nationalist. Whether you're educated or illiterate, whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like I am. We're all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man. He just happens to be a white man. All of us have suffered here, in this country, political oppression at the hands of the white man, economic exploitation at the hands of the white man, and social degradation at the hands of the white man.",2
NM,"Now in speaking like this, it doesn't mean that we're anti-white, but it does mean we're anti-exploitation, we're anti-degradation, we're anti-oppression. And if the white man doesn't want us to be anti-him, let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us. Whether we are Christians or Muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists, we must first learn to forget our differences. If we have differences, let us differ in the closet; when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man. If the late President Kennedy could get together with Khrushchev and exchange some wheat, we certainly have more in common with each other than Kennedy and Khrushchev had with each other.",2
NM,"If we don't do something real soon, I think you'll have to agree that we're going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet. It's one or the other in 1964. It isn't that time is running out -- time has run out!",2
NM,"1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has ever witnessed. The most explosive year. Why? It's also a political year. It's the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the so-called Negro community jiving you and me for some votes. The year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and their treachery, with their false promises which they don't intend to keep. As they nourish these dissatisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an explosion; and now we have the type of black man on the scene in America today -- I'm sorry, Brother Lomax -- who just doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer.",2
NM,"Don't let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you. If they draft you, they send you to Korea and make you face 800 million Chinese. If you can be brave over there, you can be brave right here. These odds aren't as great as those odds. And if you fight here, you will at least know what you're fighting for.",2
NM,"I'm not a politician, not even a student of politics; in fact, I'm not a student of much of anything. I'm not a Democrat. I'm not a Republican, and I don't even consider myself an American. If you and I were Americans, there'd be no problem. Those Honkies that just got off the boat, they're already Americans; Polacks are already Americans; the Italian refugees are already Americans. Everything that came out of Europe, every blue-eyed thing, is already an American. And as long as you and I have been over here, we aren't Americans yet.",2
NM,"Well, I am one who doesn't believe in deluding myself. I'm not going to sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call myself a diner. Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on that plate. Being here in America doesn't make you an American. Being born here in America doesn't make you an American. Why, if birth made you American, you wouldn't need any legislation; you wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution; you wouldn't be faced with civil-rights filibustering in Washington, D.C., right now. They don't have to pass civil-rights legislation to make a Polack an American.",2
NM,"No, I'm not an American. I'm one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy. So, I'm not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a flag-waver -- no, not I. I'm speaking as a victim of this American system. And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't see any American dream; I see an American nightmare.",2
NM,"These 22 million victims are waking up. Their eyes are coming open. They're beginning to see what they used to only look at. They're becoming politically mature. They are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast. As they see these new political trends, it's possible for them to see that every time there's an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount. They had to recount in Massachusetts to see who was going to be governor, it was so close. It was the same way in Rhode Island, in Minnesota, and in many other parts of the country. And the same with Kennedy and Nixon when they ran for president. It was so close they had to count all over again. Well, what does this mean? It means that when white people are evenly divided, and black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up to them to determine who's going to sit in the White House and who's going to be in the dog house.",2
NM,"lt was the black man's vote that put the present administration in Washington, D.C. Your vote, your dumb vote, your ignorant vote, your wasted vote put in an administration in Washington, D.C., that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable, saving you until last, then filibustering on top of that. And your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress we're making. And what a good president we have. If he wasn't good in Texas, he sure can't be good in Washington, D.C. Because Texas is a lynch state. It is in the same breath as Mississippi, no different; only they lynch you in Texas with a Texas accent and lynch you in Mississippi with a Mississippi accent. And these Negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the White House with a Texan, a Southern cracker -- that's all he is -- and then come out and tell you and me that he's going to be better for us because, since he's from the South, he knows how to deal with the Southerners. What kind of logic is that? Let Eastland be president, he's from the South too. He should be better able to deal with them than Johnson.",2
NM,"In this present administration they have in the House of Representatives 257 Democrats to only 177 Republicans. They control two-thirds of the House vote. Why can't they pass something that will help you and me? In the Senate, there are 67 senators who are of the Democratic Party. Only 33 of them are Republicans. Why, the Democrats have got the government sewed up, and you're the one who sewed it up for them. And what have they given you for it? Four years in office, and just now getting around to some civil-rights legislation. Just now, after everything else is gone, out of the way, they're going to sit down now and play with you all summer long -- the same old giant con game that they call filibuster. All those are in cahoots together. Don't you ever think they're not in cahoots together, for the man that is heading the civil-rights filibuster is a man from Georgia named Richard Russell. When Johnson became president, the first man he asked for when he got back to Washington, D.C., was ""Dicky"" -- that's how tight they are. That's his boy, that's his pal, that's his buddy. But they're playing that old con game. One of them makes believe he's for you, and he's got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you, he never has to keep his promise.",2
NM,"So it's time in 1964 to wake up. And when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy, let them know your eyes are open. And let them know you -- something else that's wide open too. It's got to be the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet. If you're afraid to use an expression like that, you should get on out of the country; you should get back in the cotton patch; you should get back in the alley. They get all the Negro vote, and after they get it, the Negro gets nothing in return. All they did when they got to Washington was give a few big Negroes big jobs. Those big Negroes didn't need big jobs, they already had jobs. That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-dressing. I'm not trying to knock out the Democrats for the Republicans. We'll get to them in a minute. But it is true; you put the Democrats first and the Democrats put you last.",2
NM,"Look at it the way it is. What alibis do they use, since they control Congress and the Senate? What alibi do they use when you and I ask, ""Well, when are you going to keep your promise?"" They blame the Dixiecrats. What is a Dixiecrat? A Democrat. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat in disguise. The titular head of the Democrats is also the head of the Dixiecrats, because the Dixiecrats are a part of the Democratic Party. The Democrats have never kicked the Dixiecrats out of the party. The Dixiecrats bolted themselves once, but the Democrats didn't put them out. Imagine, these lowdown Southern segregationists put the Northern Democrats down. But the Northern Democrats have never put the Dixiecrats down. No, look at that thing the way it is. They have got a con game going on, a political con game, and you and I are in the middle. It's time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is, and trying to understand it like it is; and then we can deal with it like it is.",2
NM,"The Dixiecrats in Washington, D.C., control the key committees that run the government. The only reason the Dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority. The only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where Negroes can't vote. This is not even a government that's based on democracy. lt. is not a government that is made up of representatives of the people. Half of the people in the South can't even vote. Eastland is not even supposed to be in Washington. Half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in Washington, D.C., are there illegally, are there unconstitutionally.",2
NM,"I was in Washington, D.C., a week ago Thursday, when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor. And in the back of the room where the Senate meets, there's a huge map of the United States, and on that map it shows the location of Negroes throughout the country. And it shows that the Southern section of the country, the states that are most heavily concentrated with Negroes, are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the Negro from being able to vote. This is pitiful. But it's not pitiful for us any longer; it's actually pitiful for the white man, because soon now, as the Negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that he's in, sees the bag that he's in, sees the real game that he's in, then the Negro's going to develop a new tactic.",2
NM,"These senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote. And the Constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated. You don't even need new legislation. Any person in Congress right now, who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated, that particular person should be expelled from Congress. And when you expel him, you've removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country. In fact, when you expel them, you don't need new legislation, because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority, not in the minority.",2
NM,"If the black man in these Southern states had his full voting rights, the key Dixiecrats in Washington, D. C., which means the key Democrats in Washington, D.C., would lose their seats. The Democratic Party itself would lose its power. It would cease to be powerful as a party. When you see the amount of power that would be lost by the Democratic Party if it were to lose the Dixiecrat wing, or branch, or element, you can see where it's against the interests of the Democrats to give voting rights to Negroes in states where the Democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the Civil War. You just can't belong to that Party without analyzing it.",2
NM,"I say again, I'm not anti-Democrat, I'm not anti-Republican, I'm not anti-anything. I'm just questioning their sincerity, and some of the strategy that they've been using on our people by promising them promises that they don't intend to keep. When you keep the Democrats in power, you're keeping the Dixiecrats in power. I doubt that my good Brother Lomax will deny that. A vote for a Democrat is a vote for a Dixiecrat. That's why, in 1964, it's time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for; what we're supposed to get when we cast a ballot; and that if we don't cast a ballot, it's going to end up in a situation where we're going to have to cast a bullet. It's either a ballot or a bullet.",2
NM,"In the North, they do it a different way. They have a system that's known as gerrymandering, whatever that means. It means when Negroes become too heavily concentrated in a certain area, and begin to gain too much political power, the white man comes along and changes the district lines. You may say, ""Why do you keep saying white man?"" Because it's the white man who does it. I haven't ever seen any Negro changing any lines. They don't let him get near the line. It's the white man who does this. And usually, it's the white man who grins at you the most, and pats you on the back, and is supposed to be your friend. He may be friendly, but he's not your friend.",2
NM,"So, what I'm trying to impress upon you, in essence, is this: You and I in America are faced not with a segregationist conspiracy, we're faced with a government conspiracy. Everyone who's filibustering is a senator -- that's the government. Everyone who's finagling in Washington, D.C., is a congressman -- that's the government. You don't have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are a part of the government. The same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights, deprive you of your economic opportunities, deprive you of decent housing, deprive you of decent education. You don't need to go to the employer alone, it is the government itself, the government of America, that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country. And you should drop it in their lap. This government has failed the Negro. This so-called democracy has failed the Negro. And all these white liberals have definitely failed the Negro.",2
NM,"So, where do we go from here? First, we need some friends. We need some new allies. The entire civil-rights struggle needs a new interpretation, a broader interpretation. We need to look at this civil-rights thing from another angle -- from the inside as well as from the outside. To those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, the only way you can get involved in the civil-rights struggle is give it a new interpretation. That old interpretation excluded us. It kept us out. So, we're giving a new interpretation to the civil-rights struggle, an interpretation that will enable us to come into it, take part in it. And these handkerchief-heads who have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising -- we don't intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer.",2
NM,"How can you thank a man for giving you what's already yours? How then can you thank him for giving you only part of what's already yours? You haven't even made progress, if what's being given to you, you should have had already. That's not progress. And I love my Brother Lomax, the way he pointed out we're right back where we were in 1954. We're not even as far up as we were in 1954. We're behind where we were in 1954. There's more segregation now than there was in 1954. There's more racial animosity, more racial hatred, more racial violence today in 1964, than there was in 1954. Where is the progress?",2
NM,"And now you're facing a situation where the young Negro's coming up. They don't want to hear that ""turn the-other-cheek"" stuff, no. In Jacksonville, those were teenagers, they were throwing Molotov cocktails. Negroes have never done that before. But it shows you there's a new deal coming in. There's new thinking coming in. There's new strategy coming in. It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and something else next month. It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets. It'll be liberty, or it will be death. The only difference about this kind of death -- it'll be reciprocal. You know what is meant by ""reciprocal""? That's one of Brother Lomax's words. I stole it from him. I don't usually deal with those big words because I don't usually deal with big people. I deal with small people. I find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people. They haven't got anything to lose, and they've got every thing to gain. And they'll let you know in a minute: ""It takes two to tango; when I go, you go.""",2
NM,"The black nationalists, those whose philosophy is black nationalism, in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights, look upon it as meaning, as Brother Lomax has pointed out, equality of opportunity. Well, we're justified in seeking civil rights, if it means equality of opportunity, because all we're doing there is trying to collect for our investment. Our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood. Three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return -- I mean without a dime in return. You let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is, but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick. It got rich because you made it rich.",2
NM,"You take the people who are in this audience right now. They're poor. We're all poor as individuals. Our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything. But if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively, it'll fill up a whole lot of baskets. It's a lot of wealth. If you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year, you'll be rich -- richer than rich. When you look at it like that, think how rich Uncle Sam had to become, not with this handful, but millions of black people. Your and my mother and father, who didn't work an eight-hour shift, but worked from ""can't see"" in the morning until ""can't see"" at night, and worked for nothing, making the white man rich, making Uncle Sam rich. This is our investment. This is our contribution, our blood.",2
NM,"Not only did we give of our free labor, we gave of our blood. Every time he had a call to arms, we were the first ones in uniform. We died on every battlefield the white man had. We have made a greater sacrifice than anybody who's standing up in America today. We have made a greater contribution and have collected less. Civil rights, for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, means: ""Give it to us now. Don't wait for next year. Give it to us yesterday, and that's not fast enough.""",2
NM,"I might stop right here to point out one thing. Whenever you're going after something that belongs to you, anyone who's depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal. Understand that. Whenever you are going after something that is yours, you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation.",2
NM,"Which means segregation is against the law. Which means a segregationist is breaking the law. A segregationist is a criminal. You can't label him as anything other than that. And when you demonstrate against segregation, the law is on your side. The Supreme Court is on your side.",2
NM,"Now, who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law? The police department itself. With police dogs and clubs. Whenever you demonstrate against segregation, whether it is segregated education, segregated housing, or anything else, the law is on your side, and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer. They are breaking the law; they are not representatives of the law. Any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you, kill that dog, kill him, I'm telling you, kill that dog. I say it, if they put me in jail tomorrow, kill that dog. Then you'll put a stop to it. Now, if these white people in here don't want to see that kind of action, get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in. That's all you have to do. If you don't do it, someone else will.",2
NM,"If you don't take this kind of stand, your little children will grow up and look at you and think ""shame."" If you don't take an uncompromising stand, I don't mean go out and get violent; but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence. I'm nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me. But when you drop that violence on me, then you've made me go insane, and I'm not responsible for what I do. And that's the way every Negro should get. Any time you know you're within the law, within your legal rights, within your moral rights, in accord with justice, then die for what you believe in. But don't die alone. Let your dying be reciprocal. This is what is meant by equality. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.",2
NM,"When we begin to get in this area, we need new friends, we need new allies. We need to expand the civil-rights struggle to a higher level -- to the level of human rights. Whenever you are in a civil-rights struggle, whether you know it or not, you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam. No one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle. Civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country. All of our African brothers and our Asian brothers and our Latin-American brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States. And as long as it's civil rights, this comes under the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam.",2
NM,"But the United Nations has what's known as the charter of human rights; it has a committee that deals in human rights. You may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in Africa and in Hungary and in Asia, and in Latin America are brought before the UN, and the Negro problem is never brought before the UN. This is part of the conspiracy. This old, tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend, supposed to be in our corner, supposed to be subsidizing our struggle, and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser, never tells you anything about human rights. They keep you wrapped up in civil rights. And you spend so much time barking up the civil-rights tree, you don't even know there's a human-rights tree on the same floor.",2
NM,"When you expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights, you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the UN. You can take it before the General Assembly. You can take Uncle Sam before a world court. But the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights. Civil rights keeps you under his restrictions, under his jurisdiction. Civil rights keeps you in his pocket. Civil rights means you're asking Uncle Sam to treat you right. Human rights are something you were born with. Human rights are your God-given rights. Human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth. And any time any one violates your human rights, you can take them to the world court.",2
NM,"Uncle Sam's hands are dripping with blood, dripping with the blood of the black man in this country. He's the earth's number-one hypocrite. He has the audacity -- yes, he has -- imagine him posing as the leader of the free world. The free world! And you over here singing ""We Shall Overcome."" Expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights. Take it into the United Nations, where our African brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Asian brothers can throw their weight on our side, where our Latin-American brothers can throw their weight on our side, and where 800 million Chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side.",2
NM,Let the world know how bloody his hands are. Let the world know the hypocrisy that's practiced over here. Let it be the ballot or the bullet. Let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet.,2
NM,"When you take your case to Washington, D.C., you're taking it to the criminal who's responsible; it's like running from the wolf to the fox. They're all in cahoots together. They all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world. Here you are walking around in America, getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad, like a tin soldier, and when you get over there, people ask you what are you fighting for, and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek. No, take Uncle Sam to court, take him before the world.",2
NM,"By ballot I only mean freedom. Don't you know -- I disagree with Lomax on this issue -- that the ballot is more important than the dollar? Can I prove it? Yes. Look in the UN. There are poor nations in the UN; yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making a move. They have one nation -- one vote, everyone has an equal vote. And when those brothers from Asia, and Africa and the darker parts of this earth get together, their voting power is sufficient to hold Sam in check. Or Russia in check. Or some other section of the earth in check. So, the ballot is most important.",2
NM,"Right now, in this country, if you and I, 22 million African-Americans -- that's what we are -- Africans who are in America. You're nothing but Africans. Nothing but Africans. In fact, you'd get farther calling yourself African instead of Negro. Africans don't catch hell. You're the only one catching hell. They don't have to pass civil-rights bills for Africans. An African can go anywhere he wants right now. All you've got to do is tie your head up. That's right, go anywhere you want. Just stop being a Negro. Change your name to Hoogagagooba. That'll show you how silly the white man is. You're dealing with a silly man. A friend of mine who's very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in Atlanta before they called themselves desegregated. He went into a white restaurant, he sat down, they served him, and he said, ""What would happen if a Negro came in here?

NM,"So, you're dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind, his intelligence, every day. He's frightened. He looks around and sees what's taking place on this earth, and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction. The dark people are waking up. They're losing their fear of the white man. No place where he's fighting right now is he winning. Everywhere he's fighting, he's fighting someone your and my complexion. And they're beating him. He can't win any more. He's won his last battle. He failed to win the Korean War. He couldn't win it. He had to sign a truce. That's a loss.",2
NM,"Any time Uncle Sam, with all his machinery for warfare, is held to a draw by some rice eaters, he's lost the battle. He had to sign a truce. America's not supposed to sign a truce. She's supposed to be bad. But she's not bad any more. She's bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb, but she can't use hers for fear Russia might use hers. Russia can't use hers, for fear that Sam might use his. So, both of them are weapon-less. They can't use the weapon because each's weapon nullifies the other's. So the only place where action can take place is on the ground. And the white man can't win another war fighting on the ground. Those days are over The black man knows it, the brown man knows it, the red man knows it, and the yellow man knows it. So they engage him in guerrilla warfare. That's not his style. You've got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior, and he hasn't got any heart. I'm telling you now.",2
NM,"I just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because, before you know it, before you know it. It takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because you're on your own. In conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up -- planes over your head and all that kind of stuff. But a guerrilla is on his own. All you have is a rifle, some sneakers and a bowl of rice, and that's all you need -- and a lot of heart. The Japanese on some of those islands in the Pacific, when the American soldiers landed, one Japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off. He'd just wait until the sun went down, and when the sun went down they were all equal. He would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush, and from American to American. The white soldiers couldn't cope with that. Whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the Pacific, he has the shakes, he has a nervous condition, because they scared him to death.",2
NM,"The same thing happened to the French up in French Indochina. People who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the heavily-mechanized French army out of Indochina. You don't need it -- modern warfare today won't work. This is the day of the guerrilla. They did the same thing in Algeria. Algerians, who were nothing but Bedouins, took a rine and sneaked off to the hills, and de Gaulle and all of his highfalutin' war machinery couldn't defeat those guerrillas. Nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare. It's not his speed. Just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in Asia and in parts of Africa and in parts of Latin America, you've got to be mighty naive, or you've got to play the black man cheap, if you don't think some day he's going to wake up and find that it's got to be the ballot or the bullet.",2
NM,"l would like to say, in closing, a few things concerning the Muslim Mosque, Inc., which we established recently in New York City. It's true we're Muslims and our religion is Islam, but we don't mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities -- not any more We keep our religion in our mosque. After our religious services are over, then as Muslims we become involved in political action, economic action and social and civic action. We become involved with anybody, any where, any time and in any manner that's designed to eliminate the evils, the political, economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community.",2
NM,"The political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community; no more. The black man in the black community has to be re-educated into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return. Don't be throwing out any ballots. A ballot is like a bullet. You don't throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket.",2
NM,"They don't know what morals are. They don't try and eliminate an evil because it's evil, or because it's illegal, or because it's immoral; they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence. So you're wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like Uncle Sam. If he had a conscience, he'd straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him. So it is not necessary to change the white man's mind. We have to change our own mind. You can't change his mind about us. We've got to change our own minds about each other. We have to see each other with new eyes. We have to see each other as brothers and sisters. We have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony that's necessary to get this problem solved ourselves. How can we do this? How can we avoid jealousy? How can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community? I'll tell you how.",2

Brothers and sisters, always remember, if it doesn't take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man, it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or Supreme Court decisions to give freedom to the black man.

But we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause we're against a segregated school system. A segregated school system produces children who, when they graduate, graduate with crippled minds. But this does not mean that a school is segregated because it's all black. A segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever.",2

It�s not worth name-calling, cheating, accusing people of cheating, or injuring your has-been self.  It�s slow-pitch softball.  If it were more serious, they�d call it something else.",2
NM,"You can level the playing field if your team pulls together an extra $250 and gets a decent bat every season.  For reasons scientific and unfathomable, softball bats seem to lose their �pop� after a season or so.  Certain bats also just make the ball fly like that dusty thing you�re swinging simply cannot.  Just the confidence of having such an instrument in the hands of your average hitter is worth the purchase.",2
NM,"Why would you enter a team in a co-ed softball league if you didn�t plan on using any of your female players?  So, here is my message to female softball players and the team managers who perpetually stick them at the bottom of the order playing catcher, second base, and right field: you�re not helping.  If you haven�t played a lot of ball in your life, the only way to get better is to get up there and take your cuts.  Take a few ground balls off the shins, be aggressive on a 2-strike count, and try and stretch a double into a triple.  It�s completely arcane to believe that women are incapable of competing evenly in a softball league where the prize for first place is usually a big bag of nothing and at most a plastic trophy.",2
NM,"�There is something intrinsically wonderful about taking to a patch of dirt and playing a full-fledged game of softball.  �There�s a level of orchestration there that only adults are capable of.  Its antiquity� no scoreboards, old-timey terminology, funny socks, is part of its charm.  The fact that nearly every company with more than 10 people can and usually does field a team at some point, is unique solely to this country�",2
NM,"Distressed by the increasing rates of violence, adolescent suicide, premature sexual activity, and a host of other pathological and social ills assaulting American youth, we propose that schools and teachers reassert their responsibility as educators of character. Schools cannot, however, assume this responsibility alone; families, neighborhoods and faith communities must share in this task together. We maintain that authentic educational reform in this nation begins with our response to the call for character. True character education is the hinge upon which academic excellence, personal achievement, and true citizenship depend. It calls forth the very best from our students, faculty, staff and parents.",2
NM,Education is an Inescapable Moral Enterprise. A continuous and conscious effort to guide students to know and pursue what is good and what is worthwhile. We strongly affirm parents as the primary moral educators of their children and believe schools should build a partnership with the home. Character education is about developing virtues � good habits and dispositions which lead students to responsible and mature adulthood.,2
NM,"The teacher and the school principal are central to this enterprise and must be educated, selected, and encouraged with this mission in mind. Character education is not a single course, a quick-fix program, or a slogan posted on the wall; it is an integral part of school life. The human community has a reservoir of moral wisdom, much of which exists in our great stories, works of art, literature, history, and biography. Finally, young people need to realize that forging their own characters is an essential and demanding life task.",2
NM,"Character education is not merely an educational trend or the school�s latest fad; it is a fundamental dimension of good teaching, an abiding respect for the intellect and spirit of the individual. We need to re-engage the hearts, minds, and hands of our children in forming their own characters, helping them �to know the good, love the good, and do the good.� That done, we will truly be a nation of character, securing �liberty and justice for all.�",2
NM,"I chase an ideal, I choose to chase passion. The shortest lasting happiness that is based off stimuli and always chasing the next high.  It is this happiness that most people focus on with things like material possessions or sex, yet it has been proven to be a very fleeting form of happiness.",2
NM,The second longest form of happiness is Passion.  Passion refers to a state in which you achieve �flow� or what is sometimes referred to as �being in the zone.�   Time passes without notice when you are passionate. When you find something that not only gives you pleasure but also becomes a passion then you have achieved this second level of happiness.,2
NM,"The longest lasting form of happiness is being connected to or with a higher purpose.  This supports Maslow�s Hierarchy of Needs that states once the basic fundamentals of life are met, human beings desire to be connected to a higher purpose or something bigger than themselves.  It is this purpose or ideal that in turn gives purpose and meaning to life.",2
NM,"As a general rule, the vast majority of the population chooses to chase pleasure and vow to get to passion and purpose once they reach the proper amount of happiness.  When in reality to achieve long lasting happiness you must actually do the exact opposite.  Find your purpose first and then layer passion on top of your purpose and ultimately find the pleasure that comes along with it, not the other way around.",2
NM,"This is a concept that I believe we all know inherently, but we lose over time as the world pushes us back to and rewards us for pleasure based happiness.  To have seen this concept so simply laid out like above was a turning point in my belief system, lifestyle and life. Just as the surf bum spends his days in search of Zen through surfing and the stoke that goes along with every wave, we too must each find our own purpose and have the courage and strength to pursue it.",2
NM,The term �graphic design� has been technologically undermined. A better term is visual communication design. Visual communication design has become more and more a profession that integrates idioms and approaches of several disciplines in a multi-layered and in-depth visual competence. Boundaries between disciplines are becoming more fluid. Nevertheless designers need to recognize professional limitations.,2
NM,Many changes have occurred. Developments in media technology and the information economy have profoundly affected visual communication design practice and education. New challenges confront the designer. The variety and complexity of design issues has expanded. The resulting challenge is the need for a more advanced ecological balance between human beings and their socio-cultural and natural environment.,2
NM,"A visual communication designer is a professional who contributes to shaping the visual landscape of culture, who focuses on the generation of meaning for a community of users, not only interpreting their interest but offering conservative and innovative solutions as appropriate, who collaboratively solves problems and explores possibilities through the systematic practice of criticism, who is an expert that conceptualizes and articulates ideas into tangible experiences, whose approach is grounded in a symbiotic conduct that respects the diversity of environmental and cultural contexts not by overemphasizing differences, but by recognizing common ground, who carries an individual responsibility for ethics to avoid harm and takes into account the consequences of design action to humanity, nature, technology, and cultural facts.",2
NM,"The new design program includes the following dimensions: image, text, movement, time, sound, and interactivity. Design education should focus on a critical mentality combined with tools to communicate. It should nurture a self-reflective attitude and ability. The new program should foster strategies and methods for communication and collaboration.",2
NM,"More than ever, design education must prepare students for change. To this end, it must move from being teaching-centered to a learning-centered environment which enables students to experiment and to develop their own potential in and beyond academic programs. Thus the role of a design educator shifts from that of only knowledge provider to that of a person who inspires and facilitates orientation for a more substantial practice. The power to think the future, �near or far,� should be an integral part of visual communication design. A new concept in design promises to tune nature, humanity, and technology, and to harmonize east and west, north and south, as well as past, present, and future in a dynamic equilibrium. This is the essence of Oullim, the great harmony. ",2
NM,"We believe in a free press that informs, entertains and holds the powerful to account. This is as true now as it was in the 17th century when Milton first argued against press censorship. The newspapers of the 1640s were as partisan and populist as anything available today. We shouldn�t let today�s scandal disrupt our historic belief in the free press.",2
NM,"We believe that there is a public interest in exposing crime, corruption and impropriety, where this affects the public. The �public interest� is the holy grail in this debate; if we could define it, we could support newspapers that pursue it (even into legal and moral grey areas), while punishing those that use it to justify hacking and harassment. The test is whether media revelations affect our lives � our consumer choices and our voting. There is no public interest in titillation.",2
NM,"We believe in the artistic freedom to explore and depict the life of our society in whatever form we choose. Artists and writers have the same right to free speech as the news media. Unless they are also to be subject to new restrictions, the same principles should apply to press freedom and artistic freedom.",2
NM,"We believe that everyone has the right to tell or sell the story of their own life, even where this touches upon the lives of others, unless they have explicitly promised not to do so. Since the birth of western literature, writers have written �what they know� � routinely invading the privacy of their friends, families and lovers in the process. What�s the difference between these works of art and a kiss-and-tell story? Free speech is about the freedom to express ourselves � however crudely.",2
NM,"We believe that society is able to set moral standards around free speech and privacy without legal sanctions, except in the most extreme circumstances. If someone does kiss and tell, in either a tabloid newspaper or a literary memoir, society has the ability to turn their backs on them. Aren�t social sanctions more powerful than legal penalties anyway?",2
NM,"We believe that any legal constraints on artistic and press freedom should only be used to prevent irreparable, substantial and serious harm to individuals. The law is a powerful, if sometimes blunt, instrument. It is not there for brand management.",2
NM,"We believe that pre-publication injunctions should only be available when there is an overwhelming likelihood of irreparable, serious and substantial harm. Injunctions are one of the most powerful weapons in the state�s armoury and should not be used lightly. They should only be applied if the harm, once done, could never be undone.",2
NM,"We believe that the state should not control the press other than through the administration of impartial and transparent criminal and civil justice. The courts are obliged to balance articles 8 and 10 of the European convention on human rights but this should be a last resort. We should be confident in self-regulation, and our own right of reply.",2
NM,"We believe in the right to live our lives without intrusion or surveillance by public or private bodies. Let�s not forget that, while we�re worrying about the newspapers, we�re forsaking great swathes of our privacy by giving data to the state and to private companies, which have a poor track record of protecting it.",2
NM,"We believe that if we supply data to public or private bodies this should only be sold or conveyed onwards with our express permission. Private data is not fair game for blaggers or advertisers. This is where all of us � not just a few celebrities, or unfortunate victims of the News of the World � are exposed to the privacy invaders, and this is where tougher laws really are needed.",2

NM,"To all you advertisers, marketers and media buyers out there � Have you ever considered the fact that at least a portion of your audience hates you? OK, maybe they don�t hate you. But you sure do annoy the heck out of them? At least the 75% that aren�t the right audience to begin with. After all, you interrupt their favorite programs with ads they don�t want to watch, for products they don�t intend to buy. They�re not customers; they�re freeloaders. ",2
NM,"They get their favorite shows for free, while you fund those shows for them with your ad dollars. And they�re ruining your advertising ROI. So why not get rid of the freeloaders and replace them with customers? After all, whether your audience wants to admit it, you are paying good money to entertain them. There�s no such thing as a free lunch. Just like Google users put up with display ads, NPR listeners tolerate fundraising drives, and magazine readers deal with those annoying little postcards, television audiences have always had to suffer through commercial breaks or make quick pit stops at the fridge.",2
NM,"Since the beginning of television, this has been an unwritten understanding between programmers, advertisers, and viewers: One plays, one pays, one stays. But these days, audiences no longer have to stay. They can skip commercials without even leaving the couch. They can watch online with lighter commercial loads, if any. They can even pay directly for content, cutting you out of the mix altogether. (Another Steve Jobs legacy: There are few if any freeloaders in Apple�s world; every customer gets what he/she pays for.)",2
NM,"Even so, television remains the most powerful marketing medium around. ??Data from eMarketer shows TV ad spending keeping pace with online. And even though TV is projected to stay flat over the next four years while Internet grows by 40% (as a percentage of overall  marketing spend, that is),  TV ad revenues will still be 50%  greater than Internet ad revenues in 2015. As Sam Gustin wrote in Wired a few months ago, �Advertisers know they can still reach millions of people�who flock to such programming as �Jersey Shore,� �Glee� and �Gossip Girl.�",2
NM,"A Microsoft/BBDO joint report cited by Bloomberg News chalked television�s unmatched marketing resonance up to the fact that �its audience is receptive and waiting to be entertained.� But TV advertising � any advertising, in fact � only works when it reaches the right audiences. And remember that demographics don�t buy products, consumers do. So you need to make sure that the programming you pay for is going to entertain viewers who are interested in purchasing your product. And that means minimizing freeloaders. So don�t cut your ad budgets, cut the waste out of them. Let�s face it: Freeloaders aren�t going away.",2
NM,"Not unless you change where you advertise by honing your media strategy. The data�s there � set-top-box data, household-purchase info, demographic data � but it�s up to you to use it. And you don�t have to necessarily buy the long tail in order to get the last 20 points of reach. Use the solution that gives you the reach you want � at the price you want � against your own current ROI-driving purchaser segments. Replace the freeloaders in your audience with customers who are interested in your product, and who buy your product (or your competitor�s product, if you�re feeling feisty).

NM,"The bikers and walkers, which neither slurp government dollars nor consume natural resources at the pace of the drivers, demand safer streets and sidewalks. As the Economist suggested on September 3 when responding to Seattle�s spate of recent cyclist deaths, cars on streets with bike lanes must be subjected to �traffic calming� methods already used in European capitals like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Portland. When cars must slow down below 20 miles per hour, they kill less than 5 percent of collision victims. And the busiest bike lanes must be physically protected from the four-wheeled instruments of death through concrete buffers, rows of trees, or other barriers. In some places, whole streets�yes, whole streets, we have plenty to spare�must be closed to cars, creating bike and pedestrian malls and paths of the kind found throughout more forward-thinking, class-conscious cities.",2

Authoritarian regimes create forces which oppose them by pushing against apeople�s will to truth, love and self-realization. Plans which assist authoritarian rule, once discovered, induce further resistance. Hence such schemes are concealed by successful authoritarian powers until resistance is futile or outweighed by the efficiencies of naked power. This collaborative secrecy, working to the detriment of a population, is enough to define their behavior as conspiratorial. Thus it happens in matters of state; for knowing afar off (which it is only given a prudent man to do) the evils that are brewing, they are easily cured. But when, for want of such knowledge, they are allowed to grow until everyone can recognize them, there is nolonger any remedy to be found.",2
NM,"Pre and post 9/11 the Maryland Procurement Office and others have funded mathematicians to look at terrorist conspiracies as connected graphs (no mathematical background is needed to follow this article). We extend this understanding of terrorist organizations and turn it on the likes of its paymasters; transforming it into a knife to dissect the conspiracies used to maintain authoritarian power structures. We will use connected graphs as a way to apply our spatial reasoning abilities to political relationships. These graphs are very easy to visualize. First take some nails (�conspirators�) and hammer them into a board at random. Then take twine (�communication�) and loop it from nail to nail without breaking. Call the twine connecting two nails a link. Unbroken twine means it is possible to travel from any nail to any other nail via twine and intermediary nails. Mathematicians say that this type of graph is connected. Information flows from conspirator to conspirator. Not every conspirator trusts or knows every other conspirator even though all are connected. Some are on the fringe of the conspiracy, others are central and communicate with many conspirators and others still may know only two conspirators but be a bridge between important sections or groupings of the conspiracy.",2
NM,"If all conspirators are assassinated or all the links between them are destroyed, then a conspiracy no longer exists. This is usually requires more resources than we can deploy, so we ask our first question: What is the minimum numberof links that must be cut to separate the conspiracy into two groups of equalnumber? (divide and conquer). The answer depends on the structure of theconspiracy. Sometimes there are no alternative paths for conspiratorial information to flow between conspirators, othertimes there are many. This is a useful and interesting characteristic of a conspiracy. For instance, by assassinating one �bridge� conspirator, it may be possible to split a conspiracy. But we want to say something about all conspiracies.",2
NM,"Conspirators are often discerning, for some trust and depend each other, while others say little. Important information flows frequently through some links, trivial information through others. So we expand our simple connected graph model to include not only links, but their �importance�. Return to our board-and-nails analogy. Imagine a thick heavy cord between some nails and fine light thread between others. Call the importance, thickness or heaviness of a link its weight. Between conspirators that never communicate the weight is zero. The �importance� of communication passing through a link is difficult to evaluate apriori, since its true value depends on the outcome of the conspiracy. We simply say that the �importance� of communication contributes to the weight of a link in the most obvious way; the weight of a link is proportional to the amount of important communication flowing across it. Questions about conspiracies in general won�t require us to know the weight of any link, since that changes from conspiracy to conspiracy.",2
NM,"Conspiracies take information about the world in which they operate (the conspiratorial environment), pass through the conspirators and then act on the result. We can see conspiracies as a type of device that has inputs (information about the environment), a computational network (the conspirators and their links to each other) and outputs (actions intending to change or maintain the environment). Since a conspiracy is a type of cognitive device that acts on information acquired from its environment, distorting or restricting these inputs means acts based on them are likely to be misplaced. Programmers call this effect garbage in, garbage out. Usually the effect runs the other way; it is conspiracy that is the agent of deception and information restriction. In the US, the programmer�s aphorism is sometimes called �the Fox News effect�",2
NM,"We could count the number of conspirators, but that would not capture the key difference between a conspiracy and the individuals which comprise it. How do they differ? In a conspiracy, individuals conspire, while when isolated they do not. We can show most of this difference by adding up all the important communication (weights) between all the conspirators. Call this total conspiratorial power.",2
NM,"All voting is a sort of gaming, like checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral questions; and betting naturally accompanies it. The character of the voters is not staked. I cast my vote, perchance, as I think right; but I am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail. I am willing to leave it to the majority. Its obligation, therefore, never exceeds that of expediency. Even voting for the right is doing nothing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men. When the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will be because they are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by their vote.

We know that software can�t be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can�t be shut down.",2
NM,"The greatest crime of Marxism wasn�t simply that much of what it claimed was false, but that it claimed to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality. Cybernetic eschatology shares with some of history�s worst ideologies a doctrine of historical predestination. There is nothing more gray, stultifying, or dreary than a life lived inside the confines of a theory. Let us hope that the cybernetic totalists learn humility before their day in the sun arrives.",2
NM,"That biology and physics will merge with computer science (becoming biotechnology and nanotechnology), resulting in life and the physical universe becoming mercurial; achieving the supposed nature of computer software. Furthermore, all of this will happen very soon! Since computers are improving so quickly, they will overwhelm all the other cybernetic processes, like people, and will fundamentally change the nature of what�s going on in the familiar neighborhood of Earth at some moment when a new �criticality� is achieved- maybe in about the year 2020. To be a human after that moment will be either impossible or something very different than we now can know.",2
NM,"Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's yours.",2
NM,"Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.",2
NM,"Everyone tries to make his life a work of art. We want love to last and we know that it does not last; even if, by some miracle, it were to last a whole lifetime, it would still be incomplete. Perhaps, in this insatiable need for perpetuation, we should better understand human suffering, if we knew that it was eternal. It appears that great minds are, sometimes, less horrified by suffering than by the fact that it does not endure. In default of inexhaustible happiness, eternal suffering would at least give us a destiny. But we do not even have that consolation, and our worst agonies come to an end one day. One morning, after many dark nights of despair, an irrepressible longing to live will announce to us the fact that all is finished and that suffering has no more meaning than happiness.",2
NM,"Whatever we may do, excess will always keep its place in the heart of man, in the place where solitude is found. We all carry within us our places of exile, our crimes and our ravages. But our task is not to unleash them on the world; it is to fight them in ourselves and in others.",2
NM,"Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men�men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised man.",2
